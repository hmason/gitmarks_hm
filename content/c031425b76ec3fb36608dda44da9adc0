            and scientific.&nbsp; They are known as loofah, smooth loofah, loofah 
            sponge, loofa, luffa, loufa, loufah, sponge gourd, Chinese okra, elephant 
            okra, dishrag gourd, and other common names in many different languages.&nbsp; 
            The scientific names for the plant we grow include Luffa cylindrica, 
            Luffa aegyptiaca, or Luffa aegyptica. There are also several other 
            related species within the Luffa genus, like Luffa acutangula.</font></p>

            plants including gourds, pumpkins, and cucumbers. It grows as a flowering 
            annual vine of subtropical Asian origin. The pollinated flowers grow 
            cylindrical green fruits that eventually develop into a seed pod filled 
            with many intertwined plant cellulose fibers. The skin is removed 
            to reveal the &quot;loofah&quot; inside. </p>
          <p>Sea sponges are part of the animal kingdom. They grow on the sea

            These natural cellulose fiber sponge wonders of the vegetable world 
            have many uses. They can exfoliate the loose cells from your skin 
            and make you skin squeaky clean or shine up your dirty dishes.&nbsp;Luffa 
            are most excellent in the bath or shower. The exfoliating action leaves 
            your skin feeling the cleanest and tightest it could possibly be.&nbsp; 
            Scrubbing your back with a luffa sponge in the bath or shower is an 
            incredibly pleasurable experience.&nbsp; Home artisan craft soap makers 
            include slices of luffa in their creations to add an extra cleaning 
            boost to their <a href="images/LuffaSoap.jpg">soaps</a>. Shredded 
            or powdered luffa can be also be mixed into soap.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">Luffa sponges are great for washing items like large 
            pots and other containers<font face="Verdana">.&nbsp; We use them 
            for cleaning almost everything, including cars, boats, plastic buckets, 
            and anything that needs scrubbed but can't withstand steel wool.&nbsp; 
            Non stick cookware is one example.</font></font></p>

            cut lengthwise with the core removed to make sheets of sponge material. 
            These sheets of luffa material can be sewn into items like table hot 
            pads, sandals, bath mats, hats, or anything else you can imagine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

          <p><font size="3">The luffa buds, flowers, and soft young fruits are 
            sometimes cooked and eaten like squash or okra. Luffa has been an 
            important food source in many cultures. The tough fibrous vines are 
            not edible, but leaves may be eaten by some people depending how bitter 
            they are.&nbsp; Sap in the luffa vines and leaves contains a bitter 
            compound with a musky smell that seems to repel insects and animals. 
            It tastes similar to the bitterness sometimes found in cucumbers, 
            a close plant relative also in the Cucurbitaceae family. We don't 
            know what this stuff is, maybe some bright botanist or biochemist 
            can fill us in and we'll post it here. </font><font size="3" face="Verdana"> 
            </font><font size="3"> According to some <a href="http://www.bpi.da.gov.ph/Publications/mp/html/p/patola.htm" target="_blank">sources</a> 
            a fellow named Wehmer identified a substance known as luffeine for 
            the bitterness of Luffa acutangula, a related species grown commonly 
            for food. </font><font size="3" face="Verdana">Luffa, like many plants, 
            contains a variety of substances. Parts of the plant and seeds have 
            been used for the medicinal properties. Powdered luffa fibers have 
            been an ingredient in traditional Chinese herbal medicine. One Egyptian 
            <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T8D-45W3WNN-N&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=295d4741a44a1161ea0be3a052c6921b" target="_blank">study</a> 
            found the seeds of luffa reduced blood glucose levels in animals. 
            More medicinal references can be found on our <a href="luffalinks.htm">links</a> 
            page.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">We eat small luffa fruits when in season, but we disclaim 
            any legal responsibility for any bad reactions anyone might have from 
            consuming luffa. Eat at your own risk. Those with sensitivities to 
            certain foods should proceed with caution. Unknown allergy potential.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3"> The edible size fruits taste something like a cross 
            between a zucchini and a cucumber. Some luffa varieties may produce 
            fruits that are too bitter to eat. Peeling the skin off reduces bitterness 
            but is probably not usually necessary to do so. If it tastes bad, 
            don't eat it. The many varieties we've grown have all tasted good 
            to us, with some being better than others. Many commonly cultivated 
            varieties are edible. Luffa of several different species are consumed 
            by people around the world, especially in Asia and Africa. Edible 
            luffa can sometimes be found in markets with Asian style vegetables. 
            We like them sliced in a stir-fry or just sauteed in a little olive 
            oil. Seasoning with a dash of soy sauce and cayenne pepper makes a 
            tasty appetizer. The big yellow flowers have a crunchy green flavor 
            similar to celery or cucumber. Luffa flowers make a colorful and unique 
            salad. </font> </p>

        <td width="80%" height="38"><font size="3">New unused luffa fiber can 
          be stored for years if it is kept dry. It needs to be covered where 
          dust won't settle on the surface. Working luffa sponges will last a 
          surprisingly long time if they are allowed to dry between uses, usually 
          a few months.&nbsp; When they stay wet all the time they tend to deteriorate 
          more. Hanging on a hook or placing on end may help your loofah to dry. 
          A luffa sponge can hold some dirt and should not be used for different 
          purposes. If you scrub your cooking grill with it, then don't use it 
          on your skin. It is probably difficult to fully sterilize a loofah. 
          Enough heat applied long enough would do it but might damage the luffa 
          fibers. A short soak in a mild bleach solution gets close, certainly 
          killing off a vast majority of surface germs</font>. A wash with antibacterial 
          hand soap should quickly remove many germs too. Sunlight can help keep 
          your loofah in top shape by drying it faster and irradiating the surface 
          with natural ultraviolet light. The drying UV rays will make it harder 
          for germs, mold, or mildew to grow. 
          <p><font size="3">Some commercial luffa sponges are a light color from 
            being bleached.&nbsp; Natural mature sponges can be any shade of dark 
            brown to bright white in color.&nbsp; Most loofahs are fine in their 
            natural state without any bleaching. If you want to lighten luffa 
            fibers, they can be soaked in a weak chlorine bleach solution for 
            about an hour or so.&nbsp; Some commercial growers may also use a 
            hydrogen peroxide or caustic solution.&nbsp; Bleaching them for too 
            long can weaken the fibers. Bleached sponges may look better for commerce. 
            They are cleaner and less likely to contain insects or other organic 
            matter. Green and/or dark stained luffa can benefit from bleaching. 
            Exposure to sunlight can also lighten the color but not as dramatically 
            as bleach. Leaving them in the sun for a day gives the loofah a rougher 
            scratchier feel. Leaving a loofah outside for longer periods will 
            tend to break down the fibers.</font></td>

        <td width="80%" height="20">Some garden varieties of luffa are coarser, 
          less dense, and more flexible than the thicker pieces of commercial 
          loofah. They are typically hardy fast growing types that give the average 
          gardener a better chance at success than the high fiber ones. The commercial 
          loofah is grown for consistent size and fiber density. Most are grown 
          in a hot climate and have the benefit of a long growing season. Denser 
          loofah is better for uses that require strength and durability. A less 
          dense loofah is often flexible and more easily molded into things like 
          <a href="images/LuffaSoap.jpg"> luffa soap</a>. By the way, any loofah 
          can be made more flexible by getting it wet. The thickness and number 
          of the individual fibers can vary greatly among loofah sponges.&nbsp; 
          A hard or soft sponge can have thin or thick fibers. Usually the more 
          fiber, the stiffer the loofah, but finer fibers can result in more flexibility. 
          There are also varieties that are grown primarily for eating and these 
          may produce less fiber. Luffa can cross pollinate with nearby vines 
          so it might be difficult to grow different varieties together. Whatever 
          characteristics the luffa have, they can be altered somewhat by careful 
          selection of the seeds. The plants have a lot of natural variability 
          among different plants grown from the same seeds and even between luffa 
          pods grown on the same vine. One vine could grow several different sizes 
          and shapes.

            seeds. Over time, the quality and quantity of our sponges improved. 
            We saved seeds from the earliest large sponges with good fiber. After 
            a few seasons, they were arriving sooner and larger. We tried growing 
            seeds from many sources and did find some thicker fiber that would 
            still reach maturity in our climate. Generally, the higher the density 
            of the fiber, the longer it takes to reach maturity. </p>
          <p>Luffa can grow arrow straight, slightly curved, or very curved.&nbsp; 
            One luffa variety grows very short and wide sponges.&nbsp; These are 
            typically used for pot scrubbers.&nbsp; Another type, grown more often 
            for food, produces extremely thin long fruits.&nbsp; Seeds from straight 
            ones tend to grow more straight ones, but a few curved ones usually 
            appear.&nbsp; The curved ones make good back scratchers in the shower.&nbsp; 
            When small, the fruits are very flexible and will conform to whatever 
            shape they are against.&nbsp; This can result in some very <a href="images/UnusualShapeLuffa.jpg">unusual 
            shapes</a>.&nbsp; Loofahs can also be much wider on one or both ends, 
            usually the bottom. 
          <p>The ridged or angled luffa (<i>Luffa acutangula</i>) is a different 
            species of luffa.&nbsp; It produces fiber but is often used as a food 
            crop. It can be identified by the pronounced ridges that run along 
            the skin lengthwise. It tends to be thinner, bent or curved, and more 
            elongated than the Luffa cylindrica. Edible luffa found in markets 
            is probably more often <em>acutangula</em> than the <em>cylindrica</em> 
            species.&nbsp;Luffa acutangula is also commonly known as Patola in 
            the Tagalog language of the Philippines.&nbsp;Luffa foetida is another 
            scientific name for the angled luffa. Visit our <a href="luffalinks.htm">links</a> 
            page for more info about <em>acutangula</em>. 
          <p>Another curiosity of the luffa world is the round or ball luffa. 
            Not sure what species this is and we've not encountered any of these 
            unusual luffa sponges, but the American Gourd Society has a picture 
            of one on their luffa page <a href="http://americangourdsociety.org/FAQ/types/luffa.html">here</a>.

        <td width="80%" height="20"><a href="luffagrowing.htm">Growing</a> your 
          own sponges is fun and rewarding. Once they get established, the plants 
          are quite vigorous. They grow on vines that can reach 30 feet(9m) in 
          length. A strong supporting trellis is a must. Chain link fence and 
          lattice works great. The more support points the better. The fruits 
          get very heavy. Luffa can be grown as a ground vine but it must be a 
          weedless well drained area. The pods will tend to grow curved and deformed 
          but may still get large. Luffa can often survive in partial shade with 
          some direct sunlight, but grow better in full sun. In a very hot dry 
          climate they will need some watering as they tend to wilt if it gets 
          too dry. Yearly rainfall here is typically 40 to 50 inches (102-127 
          cm). Our vines don't normally need to be watered after the roots have 
          developed. If the leaves are wilting noticeably they may need additional 
          water.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
          <p>These plants are subtropical in origin, believed to have originated 
            in southern Asia, likely in India. They need a long hot growing season. 
            Places like the US Gulf Coast are plenty hot. Starting the plants 
            indoors may be needed for cooler climates. We live around 36 degrees 
            north latitude at 1700 ft(520m) altitude, USDA zone 6b. The outdoor 
            season is long enough to produce some mature sponges planted outside 
            from seed but later ones are often lost to frost. Starting them indoors 
            and moving them outside after the last frost normally gives us a few 
            more loofahs in the fall. Planting directly into the ground is almost 
            as good. One year cool May weather stunted our plants, while seeds 
            we planted in the ground sprouted and surpassed the older plants. 
            Warm weather is necessary. Germination rates may be slightly lower 
            for outside plantings.&nbsp; Putting the seeds in a moist environment 
            before planting helps increase germination rates.&nbsp; There can 
            be a lot of variability in the time needed for germination.&nbsp; 
            It could be 3 days or over 3 weeks!&nbsp; Typically it is around a 
            week to two weeks. The drier and harder the seeds are, the longer 
            they take to germinate.&nbsp;</p>
          <p> The time it takes for luffa growth, flowering, and maturity can 
            vary widely between plants. It usually requires around 160 days or 
            more, but it could be anywhere from 130 to 220 days. Some of the sources 
            on our <a href="luffalinks.htm">luffa links</a> page also have botanical 
            and growing information.</p>
          <p>The small seedlings grow slowly while the roots become established.&nbsp; 
            Once they begin to make a vine, the increase in growth rate is phenomenal.&nbsp; 
            After 1 to 2 months of growing, the flower clusters appear.&nbsp; 
            The flowers bloom in an orderly progression as the vine lengthens. 
            Typically there is a larger solitary female flower on a thick stem 
            and a thinner stem with a cluster of male flowers.&nbsp; When the 
            vines are blooming, the bright yellow flowers attract many pollen 
            gathering creatures.&nbsp; <a href="images/luffa-flower-bumblebee.jpg">Bumblebees</a> 
            love luffa flowers and will travel great distances to reach them.&nbsp; 
            Ants enjoy cruising all over the vines and cause little or no harm, 
            assisting in pollination.&nbsp; Some female flowers will wilt and 
            fall off while the pollinated ones will form a luffa seed pod. The 
            male flowers fall off after they bloom in sequence up the stalk.&nbsp; 
            The bright yellow flowers are quite pretty and abundant.&nbsp; See 
            our <a href="luffapictures.htm"> luffa photos</a> for some examples.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>When the flowers get pollinated, slender cucumber-like vegetables 
            appear. The fruits stay soft until the skin thickens. Then the fiber 
            and seeds begin to form.&nbsp;The vines continue to grow and produce 
            new fruits while the older loofah pods mature. They can be harvested 
            whenever they feel ready. The earlier ones can be picked while the 
            vine is still growing. Typically they turn a yellow/brown color and 
            become lighter in weight from drying out.&nbsp; Mature luffa pods 
            can be any color from green to nearly black. Very small sponges can 
            be mature and very large ones may not be ready. Size and color doesn't 
            matter much. The important thing is that they start to lose water 
            weight. Time to maturity varies considerably as our sponges are picked 
            from early September to late November. The last of our loofahs are 
            harvested after a frost occurs and the vines quickly die off. The 
            more mature they are, the better the sponge fiber quality. Some smaller 
            ones may mature more quickly, yielding a small soft sponge, good for 
            washing delicate skin.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

        <td width="80%" height="20"><p>When the loofahs are ready for <a href="luffaharvest.htm">harvest</a> 
            they can be peeled. The skin loses green color and becomes looser 
            when mature. The mature sponges begin to dry and lose water weight.&nbsp; 
            If the sponges have reached full growth and feel light, they will 
            be ready to peel.&nbsp; If they are green, the loofah may contain 
            some fiber but be much harder to peel. If it falls apart when you 
            try to peel, it doesn't have enough fiber and is not mature enough.</p>
          <p>It is always best to peel them as soon as possible if the vine has 
            died. The longer the skin stays on, the darker the sponges will get. 
            Peeling greener luffa is difficult but can be done if needed.&nbsp; 
            Throwing the loofah at the ground is one trick. It's good exercise 
            for relieving your stress too. The bad ones will break apart, while 
            the good ones will crack and loosen the skin. Letting the luffas freeze 
            and thaw once on the vine also makes them easier to peel.</p>
          <p>If they have matured they are usually easy to get open.&nbsp; Getting 
            them wet or soaking in water may help the opening process but is optional. 
            After peeling, high water pressure from a hose sprayer can remove 
            much of the remaining green and brown coloration. Wash them well, 
            squeeze out excess water, lay out to dry, rotate occasionally as the 
            water settles in the lower side.&nbsp; Placing them outside in the 
            sun and wind dries them quickly.&nbsp; The sun also tends to lighten 
            the color. Hanging or placing the loofahs on a screen works well for 
            drying too. </p>
          <p>If they are stained, a soak in some bleach and water will lighten 
            them considerably.&nbsp; A wet harvest season tends to cause more 
            decay and brown spots in the sponges.&nbsp; An unusually dry fall 
            in one particular year yielded sponges that were very light in color, 
            an almost fluorescent white.&nbsp; For a photo illustrating the extreme 
            color range of some natural late wet weather sponges vs. earlier dry 
            weather sponges <a href="images/luffacolor.jpg">click here</a>.&nbsp; 
            Getting all the seeds out can be a challenge, but the drier the sponges 
            are, the easier the seeds will fall out. Save the best ones for next 
            year. You can also cut open the sponges in any shape you want to remove 
            seeds or make a loofah fiber mat.</p>
          <p>Seeds should be allowed to dry enough so they won't rot or mold and 
            then stored in a cool place. Refrigerate or freeze in a sealed airtight 
            container&nbsp;for long term storage. We've had reports of seeds as 
            old as ten years still germinating. If the seeds are allowed to get 
            too hot and dry they become hard. Some hard seeds can still germinate 
            but may take a month to sprout.</p>
