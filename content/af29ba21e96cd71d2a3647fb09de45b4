		/*
		IE5x PC mis-implements the box model. Because of that we sometimes have
		to perform a little CSS trickery to get pixel-perfect display across browsers.
		The following bit of code was proposed by Tantek Celik, and it preys upon a CSS
		parsing bug in IE5x PC that will prematurly close a style rule when it runs
		into the string "\"}\"". After that string appears in a rule, then, we can override
		previously set attribute values and only browsers without the parse bug will
		recognize the new values. So any of the name-value pairs above this comment
		that we need to override for browsers with correct box-model implementations
		will be listed below.
		
		We use the voice-family property because it is likely to be used very infrequently,
		and where it is used it will be set on the body tag. So the second voice-family value 
		of "inherit" will override out bogus "\"}\"" value and allow the proper value to
		cascade down from the body tag.

		The style rule immediately following this rule offers another chance for CSS2
		aware browsers to pick up the values meant for correct box-model implementations.
		It uses a CSS2 selector that will be ignored by IE5x PC.

	<h2>Look Ma, No Tables.</h2>
	<p>If you are looking for help making the transition to CSS layout (that's Cascading Style Sheets), you've come to the right place. I am cataloging here as many useful <em>cross-browser</em> CSS layout techniques as I can find, and some that I made up when I was bored last Thursday. All the <a href="#techniques">examples on this site</a> have been reduced to only their essential code, and you will find the source displayed on each page to hopefully make it quick and easy to understand the inner workings of the CSS. <strong>Feel free to steal all the code you find on this site</strong>, and consider linking back here on your site or in your source comments.</p>
	<p>You will also find below links to various online CSS <a href="#resources">resources</a> and <a href="#tutorials">tutorials</a>, appropriate for both the novice and the seasoned CSS veteran.</p>
	<p>I started this collection  because of the dearth of resources I found out there when I went looking for information on how to translate typical table based layouts to CSS layouts. I know it is not nearly exhaustive, so if you see that there is something missing, whether it is a particularly good tutorial, or a site that is using a complex CSS layout, please <a href="/contact.asp">let me know about it</a>. I will pay you $3750 for each link you submit that I use.</p>
	<p>If you don't have any idea why anyone cares about this topic, because like tables can do all that stuff and more, please read this: <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/tohell/">To Hell with Bad Browsers</a>. And then read this <a href="http://www.macslash.com/article.pl?sid=01/03/07/079238">follow up interview</a> with Zeldman. And then read about the Web Standards Project's <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/act/campaign/buc/">Browser Upgrade</a> campaign. The future is bright, kids!</p>

	<h2>CSS Techniques</h2>
	<p>CSS layout techniques and the sites that use them.</p>
	<div class="links">
		<p><a class="sitelinksredorange" href="7.asp">3 Columns, The Holy Grail</a> of page layouts &#151; The most elegant technique and perhaps the most sought after layout: a 3 column page with a fluid center column. Easy to understand, easy to implement. I first saw this layout at <a class="sitelinksredorange" href="http://www.wrongwaygoback.com/drd/">dynamic ribbon device</a> and have since learned that the sweet CSS came from Rob Chandanais of <a class="sitelinksredorange" href="http://www.bluerobot.com">BlueRobot</a>. Owen also made a very nice <a class="sitelinksredorange" href="http://www.thenoodleincident.com/tutorials/box_lesson/old/css_3box_plus_topbox.html">tutorial</a> using this layout technique.</p>
		<p><a class="sitelinksredorange" href="9.asp">2 Columns, ALA Style</a> &#151; Famously chronicled by Jeffrey Zeldman in his ALA article <a class="sitelinksredorange" href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/journey/"> A Web Designer's Journey</a>, this is an extremely easy layout to implement requiring only a simple float:left declaration.</p>
		<p><a class="sitelinksredorange" href="8.asp">4 Columns, All Fluid</a> &#151; This technique can actually be used to provide as many columns on a page as you like. Drawback #1) it gets difficult quickly if you want to make any of the columns a fixed width.  Drawback #2) it relies heavily on percentages, which the various browsers all calculate differently, so you can't place your columns very precisely. Still, a very useful technique, especially if you don't want borders and different background colors for your columns.</p>
		<p><a class="sitelinksredorange" href="2.asp">3 Columns, All Fluid</a> &#151; A much simpler and potentially more useful technique that then 4 column technique above. It uses float:left, suffers from needing percentage widths for each column, and from potential column wrapping when the browser window is narrowed.</p>
		<p><a class="sitelinksredorange" href="3.asp">Static Width and Centered</a> &#151; 3 columns all with static widths, and contained in a parent DIV which remains centered in the window. One rather serious limitation of this particular technique is that if any of the three content DIVs contains an image or a really long word that is longer than the width of the DIV, it totally breaks the layout. Each browser breaks it differently.</p>
		<p><a class="sitelinksredorange" href="1.asp">Nested Float</a> &#151; A very simple layout that features a nested, floated menu in the upper right. Easily reversed. A variation of this technique is in use on this very page.</p>
		<!--<p><a class="sitelinksredorange" href="">Dealing with the CSS box Model</a> &#151; IE5 Mac, NS6, Opera 5; they all handle borders and padding correctly, adding them to the width of the box. But IE5 PC gets it all wrong, placing them within the width of the box. IE5 PC's implementation is arguably easier to work with (scratch that, it <em>is</em> easier to work with), but that is beside the point. How do you deal with this discrepancy between the browsers? There are ways, my friends, there are ways.</p>-->

	<h2>CSS Resources</h2>
	<p>Specs, primers, validators, stuff like that</p>
	<div class="links">
		<p><a class="sitelinksorange" href="http://www.mako4css.com/">The CSShark Answers FAQs</a> &#151; Martina Kosloff has compiled a pretty good FAQ on CSS. Worth your time.</p>
		<p><a class="sitelinksorange" href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/">css/edge</a> &#151; From the mind of Eric Meyer comes this great little site pushing CSS to the edge. It is, in his words: "intended, first and foremost, to be as relentlessly creative with CSS as we have been practical all these years. It does <b>not</b> exist to present or explain safe cross-browser techniques; in fact, almost the opposite. The goal here is to find ways to make CSS live up to its fullest potential, with only minimal regard to browser limitations."</p>
		<p><a class="sitelinksorange" href="http://www.websitetips.com/css/index.shtml">websitetips.com CSS section</a> &#151; Literally a ton of links to CSS resources from all over. A better set of links than this one by far.</p>
		<p><a class="sitelinksorange" href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/">Guide to Cascading Style Sheets</a> from the Web Design Group. &#151; An excellent primer if you need to start from scratch. It features a tutorial, a reference section, a syntax validator, and more CSS links. A little dated, but still an excellent place to start.</p>
		<p><a class="sitelinksorange" href="http://style.webreview.com/">Style Sheet Reference Guide</a> from webreview.com. &#151; Eric Meyer's excellent resource, including the justly famous browser compatibility charts. It's a bit dated (I wish it included Opera 5 and more of CSS2) but still an excellent resource.</p>
		<p><a class="sitelinksorange" href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS School</a> from w3schools.com. &#151; A whole lot of information, references, and examples.</p>
		<p><a class="sitelinksorange" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1">Cascading Style Sheets, level 1 Recommendation</a> from the Web Design Group. &#151; This is the spec (really a rec) folks; can be very helpful if you learn how to read it.</p>

		<p> <a class="sitelinksorange" href="http://style.cleverchimp.com/">Agitprop</a> &#151; Todd Fahrner's collection of CSS writings, tests, and treatises. Good stuff.</p>
		<p> <a class="sitelinksorange" href="http://css.nu/">CSS Pointers Group</a> &#151; A great resource full of information and links to other resources on CSS. Some of it is a bit dated (but what isn't in today's modern age?), and they are all <a class="sitelinksorange" href="http://www.css.nu/examples/css-columns.html">down on multi column layouts</a>, but still a must visit.</p>
		<p> <a class="sitelinksorange" href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/">Eric Meyer's CSS work</a> &#151; The author of the O'Reilly CSS Definitive Guide, Eric has done an amazing amount of writing and work on CSS.
