<h2>Graphviz - Graph Visualization Software</h2>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
<!-- body -->
<i>graphviz</i> is Open Source, CPL licensed software.
It may be redistributed, without cost, and in other
software distributions, as long as the 
<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/License.php">license</a> terms are met.

<h3>General Installation Notes</h3>
The code related to the swig-generated bindings can sometimes cause problems.
If this happens, you will see errors for files being built in the tclpkg directory.
These bindings are not part of the core layout and rendering tools, and are
not necessary for many users. If you have problems and don't need these bindings,
try rerunning configure with the <tt>--disable-swig</tt> option.
<p>
For ordinary Graphviz builds and installation, 
the following notes can be ignored.
They are only reveleant if you decide to move the software after the
initial installation.
<p>
The Graphviz software needs to find certain files at runtime, so
one cannot just copy the binary and library files. Most importantly,
it looks for a file <tt>config<i>N</i></tt>. This file is used to
determine which layout and rendering features are available. It is 
assumed to be in the same directory as the plugin libraries.
<p>
By default, the path to the directory containing the <tt>config<i>N</i></tt>
file and the plugins is built in at build time. On Windows and Linux
systems, this path is determined dynamically using the file system
location of the gvc library. These can all be overridden by defining
the environment variable <STRONG>GVBINDIR</STRONG>.
<p>
For convenience, the Windows binary package also provides some basic
configuration files for the <tt>fontconfig</tt> library. These are stored in
the <tt>etc</tt> directory. If the Graphviz software is moved, 
this directory should probably also be moved to be in the same
directory as the Graphviz <tt>bin</tt> and <tt>lib</tt> directories.

<h3>Source Code</h3>
<a href="Download_source.php">Source code</a> for the latest stable
and development versions of Graphviz are available, along with
instructions for CVS anonymous access to the sources.  Also see
build <a href="/doc/build.html">notes</a>.
<p>
<a href="/doc/winbuild.html">Notes</a> on how
to build Graphviz on Windows. <B>N.B.</B> Except in rare cases,
such as a desire to modify the core Graphviz code, there is no
need to build Graphviz on Windows from source. We strongly recommend
that one should just install one of the available binary packages
from <a href="Download_windows.php">here</A>. If you insist, we
will answer questions but basically you are on your own.

<H3>Java Support</H3>
Grappa is a separate Java graph library and user interface that works
with Graphviz. It was written by <A HREF="http://www.research.att.com/~john">
John Mocenigo</A> in our lab. It calls Graphviz programs for remote
layout service.  Grappa can run as a browser applet (if you can resolve
the Java plugin nightmare on your own) and it provides convenient graph
programming classes.  Grappa is no longer active work, so we are not
planning major improvements or difficult bug fixes - caveat emptor.
<p>
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/~john/Grappa/grappa.tgz">Download Grappa</a>.
<p>
In our experience with Grappa applications, we encountered many
problems in trying to get applets to run under the various
incompatible versions of Java extant (didn't Sun hire any engineers who
believe
in backward compatibility?) and we found performance problems when
working with graphs of many hundreds or thousands of objects.
Our work on <A HREF="http://www.yoix.org">Yoix</A> is a new attack
to these engineering problems. Yoix itself is a web application
language, and is not Graphviz-aware. So, the base system it is not
a replacement for Grappa.  Instead, we are working on a Graphviz
extension module that loads in Yoix.  We plan to release this extension
to Yoix in late 2005 or 2006.
