<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<div><p>Research on learning technologies has unique potential to transform learning and educational opportunities, while at the same time advancing the state of the art in underlying areas of computer science and learning research. Recent advances have built on a broad base of cognitive, computational, and crossover areas of research, including reasoning, problem solving, knowledge representation, cognitive development, language and communications, human-computer interaction, information and knowledge discovery, visualization, machine learning, pedagogy, educational assessment, and numerous other fields. Learning technologies research involves core problems from both cognitive and computational research and offers an applications context well suited for integration and testing. The Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and Education and Human Resources (EHR) Directorates of the National Science Foundation aim to fully exploit both the educational potential of technology and the research potential of learning environments and learning technology platforms.</p></div>
<a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>
<h3>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
<div>
<p>Through the Advanced Learning Technologies (ALT) program, CISE and EHR support learning technologies research that (1) enables radical improvements in learning through innovative computer and information technologies, and (2) advances research in computer science, information technology, learning, and cognitive science through the unique challenges posed by learning environments and learning technology platforms. Integrative research approaches that build across disciplines and establish tight linkages among theory, experiment, and design are strongly encouraged.</p>
<p>Under this program, CISE and EHR will support research and prototyping work that is built around well defined learning and technology goals, and leads to generalizable advances in knowledge and technology. Large-scale studies, infrastructure, large-scale system development, or educational materials development will not be supported under this program. Both learning and technology goals are expected to be well articulated and significant: educational applications of off-the-shelf technologies or projects that neither model nor measure learning will not be supported under this program. <strong>Proposals that do not address both learning and technology goals may be returned without review by the program.</strong></p>
<p>Technology goals may include (but are not limited to): systems for tutoring or assessment, modeling and sensing of cognitive or emotional states, context awareness, natural language interfaces, collaboration, and knowledge management. Non-traditional goals that redefine the roles of technology in learning are encouraged.</p>
<p>Educational foci for ALT projects must include an area of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM), or general cross-cutting skills directly relevant to STEM. ALT projects may be targeted toward learning settings from pre-K through adulthood. Generalization, transfer, and learning of abstract concepts and relationships are of high interest to the program.</p>
<p>Learning and technology goals are expected to drive an integrative research strategy that builds on appropriate expertise in computer science and learning research, and facilitates close interactions among theoretical, experimental, and design aspects of a project. Proposals to ALT are expected to clearly delineate:</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
    <li>Specific learning and technology goals</li>
    <li>Research context upon which new work will build</li>
    <li>Proposed new work, including methods, measures, assessment and evaluation</li>
    <li>Research plan, integrative research strategy, and preliminary timetable</li>
</ol>
<p>Proposals to ALT should not overlap with other proposals to NSF. Proposers with pending projects in the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS) of CISE or the Division of Research, Evaluation and Communication (REC) of EHR are strongly advised to discuss their project ideas with an ALT program officer prior to submitting to the ALT program.</p></div>

<h3>III. AWARD INFORMATION</h3>
<a name="awd_txt" id="awd_txt"></a>
<div>
<p>Estimated program budget, number of awards and average award size/duration are subject to the availability of funds.</p>
<p>The program anticipates that most projects will have budgets of approximately $100,000 to $200,000 per year over three years.</p>
<p>The estimated number of awards will be 6 to 10 standard or continuing grants. The anticipated funding amount is $2,800,000 pending availability of funds.</p></div>

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a><p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program where they will be reviewed if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal.</p>
<h4><strong>A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</strong><a name="reviewproc" id="reviewproc"></a></h4>
<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts of the proposed effort. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
<p>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The criteria include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which the reviewer is qualified to make judgements.</p>
<div style="">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to resources?</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div style="">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</strong><br />
How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples illustrating activities likely to demonstrate broader impacts are available electronically on the NSF website at: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf">http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>NSF staff also will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p>
<div style="">
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Integration of Research and Education</strong></em><br />
One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</strong></em><br />
Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>

<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by&nbsp;<span>Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</span></p>
<p>Reviewers will be asked to formulate a recommendation to either support or decline each proposal. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF is striving to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later.&nbsp; The interval ends when the Division Director accepts the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
<p>A summary rating and accompanying narrative will be completed and submitted by each reviewer. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer.&nbsp; In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>
<p>In all cases, after programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications and the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>

<h3>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>
<a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>
<h4>A. Notification of the Award</h4>
<p>Notification of the award is made to<em> the submitting organization</em> by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>
<a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>
<h4>B. Award Conditions</h4>
<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award letter, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award letter; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1); * or Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Terms and Conditions * and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award letter. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>

<p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/general_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">http://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/general_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:pubs@nsf.gov">pubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>

<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award & Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
<a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>
<h4>C.  Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer at least 90 days before the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require more frequent project reports). Within 90 days after expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for that PI. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
<p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through FastLane, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. &nbsp;Such reports provide information on activities and findings, project participants (individual and organizational) publications; and, other specific products and contributions. &nbsp;PIs will not be required to re-enter information previously provided, either with a proposal or in earlier updates using the electronic system. &nbsp;Submission of the report via FastLane constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is &quot;to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
<p>NSF receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>

<p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants as part of the proposal review process; to proposer institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, NSF-50, &quot;Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records,&quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and NSF-51, &quot;Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records, &quot; 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary. Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce the possibility of receiving an award.</p>
