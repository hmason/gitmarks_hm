		<p>Thanks to recent events, it&#8217;s almost banal to talk about how the increasing ubiquity of  mobile devices and internet connectivity empowers the average Josephine on the street, but <strong>it&#8217;s worth remembering that governments aren&#8217;t the only hierarchies feeling the burn: <a title="Phone-Wielding Shoppers Strike Fear Into Retailers - Wall Street Journal" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704694004576019691769574496.html">the giants of retail commerce are starting to see the playing field flattened by price comparison apps</a></strong> <small>[via <a title="It's so useful - MetaFilter" href="http://www.metafilter.com/98617/Its-so-useful">MetaFilter</a>]</small>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Until  recently, retailers could reasonably assume that if they just lured  shoppers to stores with enticing specials, the customers could be coaxed  into buying more profitable stuff, too.</p>
<p>Now, marketers must contend with shoppers who can use their  smartphones inside stores to check whether the specials are really so  special, and if the rest of the merchandise is reasonably priced.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;The  retailer&#8217;s advantage has been eroded,&#8221; says Greg Girard of consultancy  IDC Retail Insights, which recently found that roughly 45% of customers  with smartphones had used them to perform due diligence on a store&#8217;s  prices. &#8220;The four walls of the store have become porous.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Some of the most vulnerable merchants: sellers of branded, big-ticket  items like electronics and appliances, which often prompt buyers to  comparison shop. Best Buy, the nation&#8217;s largest electronics chain, said  Tuesday that it may lose market share this year, a downward trend that  some analysts are attributing in part to pressure from price comparison  apps.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <em>WSJ</em> points out that not everyone has a smartphone capable of doing this sort of on-the-spot comparison, and that it tends to be applied to &#8220;big ticket&#8221; tech items rather than everyday bits and bobs like groceries. But <strong>if we assume that market penetration of handheld tech and mobile internet continues at its current pace, it&#8217;s not a wild leap to assume that price comparison will become a standard function, and possibly even the &#8220;killer app&#8221; that makes mobile internet appealing to those currently uninterested in its more abstract bleeding-edge &#8220;social&#8221; uses.</strong> If the Western recession continues for a few years, tools that save money will become extremely popular, and as a result we may see market forces narrowing traditionally huge profit margins very quickly indeed.</p>
<p>But hey, <strong>it&#8217;s not all about man-versus-The-Man: <a title="Big Brotheresque App Kills Your Automotive Anonymity - Wired Autopia" href="http://www.wired.com/autopia/2010/12/new-app-marks-the-end-of-automotive-anonymity/">ubicomp also lets you single out your fellow citizens for their transgressions against the public good</a></strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>DriveMeCrazy, developed by  Shazam co-founder Philip Inghelbrecht, is <strong>a voice-activated app that  encourages drivers to report bad behavior by reciting the offender’s  license plate into a smartphone. The poor sap gets “flagged” and  receives a virtual “ticket,” which may not sound like much until you  realize all the information — along with date, time and location of the “offense” — is sent to the DMV <em>and</em> insurance companies.</strong></p>
<p>Anyone can write a ticket, even pedestrians and cyclists. No one is  safe from being tattled on. <strong>Even if you don’t use the program, which  went live Wednesday, you can’t opt out of being flagged if someone  thinks you’re driving like a schmuck.</strong> Inghelbrecht is emphatic in saying  he sees no privacy issues with the app and insists the end of  road-going anonymity can only improve safety.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now there&#8217;s a delightful conundrum for modern morality: we&#8217;d all love to be able to shop that douchebag who cut us up while clocking ninety in the fast lane, but we&#8217;d hate to be stung for the two minutes we left the car in a no parking zone so we could pop into the post office on our lunch break. <strong>The ability to mutually police each other&#8217;s behaviour represents a potentially massive shift in the way we think about society&#8230; but it also opens the gates to new forms of non-hierarchical persecution, pettiness and holier-than-thou bullshit.</strong></p>
<p>For example, how about an app for reporting non-Christian (or non-Muslim, non-atheist, non-Liberal or non-Conservative) behaviour to a localised public forum? That&#8217;s sure to end well! Or <a title="Internet vigilantism - Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_vigilantism">an app for reporting people who throw pets into bins for a giggle</a>, perhaps&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a cliché to point out how much power the networked society offers us as individuals. But it&#8217;s less of a cliché, I think, to point out that <strong>we&#8217;re going to have to learn fast about the responsibility of individual and community power &#8211; not to mention a new need for mutual tolerance in a transparent world &#8211; if we want to avoid descending into a world even more dog-eat-dog than the one technology offers us an escape from</strong>. &#8220;Look first to the beam in one&#8217;s own eye&#8221;, and all that.</p>

		<p><strong>It&#8217;s a <a title="Beyond The Beyond Just another WordPress weblog Crashvertise: You Crash. We Ad. - Beyond The Beyond" href="http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2010/12/crashvertise-you-crash-we-ad/">tip o&#8217; the hat to Chairman Bruce</a> for bringing this to light: <a title="Crashvertise" href="http://www.crashvertise.com/index.html">Crashvertising</a></strong>. I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s a subversive art prank rather than a real service, (although, as the months pass by in the weird weird world of the intertubes, I get less and less confident in saying that about&#8230; well, about <em>anything</em>). But <strong>the basic premise is this: you know how everyone rubbernecks at road accidents, right? Well, the folks behind Crashvertise will hang around by road accidents with banners and placards advertising your product or service, getting full commercial value out of that captive audience</strong>. Genius, right?</p>
<div align="center"><object width="640" height="390"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Qb59dRv8kew&#038;hl=it_IT&#038;feature=player_embedded&#038;version=3"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Qb59dRv8kew&#038;hl=it_IT&#038;feature=player_embedded&#038;version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="640" height="390"></embed></object></div>
<p>Part of me is reluctant to spell out the subtext, because I&#8217;m sure you can all see it anyway. But nonetheless I&#8217;m going to take this opportunity to climb onto one of my little soapboxes, because <strong>my circle of friends both online and off contain a depressingly large subset of people: people more than smart enough to see (and deplore) the subtext of Crashvertise, but seemingly unable to make the logical leap to identifying the grotesque exploitation of shows like The X Factor, America&#8217;s Got Talent and their ilk.</strong> This frustrates me greatly. They are the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>The most common response I get from people when I call them out on watching those shows is along the lines of &#8220;oh, I know it&#8217;s dreadful, but it&#8217;s car-crash TV, isn&#8217;t it? You can&#8217;t help yourself but watch!&#8221;</strong> My counter-response has always been something remarkably similar to Crashvertise:<strong> sure, we all instinctively rubber-neck at car-crashes, but are you still morally comfortable with looking at car-crashes which have been staged with the express purpose of attracting your attention toward the billboards just behind them?</strong></p>
<p>Oh, I can hear what you&#8217;re thinking. Believe me, I&#8217;ve had every possible counter-response to my counter-response that there is: &#8220;it&#8217;s just entertainment&#8221;, &#8220;no one&#8217;s forced into doing it&#8221;, &#8220;no one gets hurt&#8221;. Well, to tackle those three in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>if The X Factor is just entertainment, then we should start encouraging and monetising bullying at schools and in workplaces rather than trying to prevent it (heck, it might help make up the funding shortfalls in the education systems, right?);</li>
<li>sure, no one is physically forced into doing it, but the cultural forces that encourage people to debase themselves so thoroughly for the chance to &#8220;become famous&#8221; (read as &#8220;be exploited even more publicly, thoroughly and systematically for the profit of others&#8221;) are insidious and incredibly powerful nonetheless, not to mention indicative of something deeply cruel, selfish and objectifying in the way we see the world;</li>
<li>and as for no one getting hurt, well, if the tabloid headlines chronicling the wrecks and burnouts on the hard shoulder of the fame highway aren&#8217;t stories of people being deeply hurt by a machine that makes money from selling their pain, I don&#8217;t know what they are.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Paul, don&#8217;t take it so seriously; it&#8217;s just a bit of fun for Saturday night! I&#8217;m not harming anyone!&#8221; Well, I&#8217;m sorry, but yes, you are.</p>
<p>And <strong>the &#8220;I&#8217;m watching it ironically!&#8221; defence is bullshit, too; in fact, that annoys me even more than the people who believe it&#8217;s a genuine competition rather than a rigged open-air market research focus group.</strong> You <em>know</em> it&#8217;s fake, you <em>know</em> it&#8217;s scripted; you know, then, that <em>everything</em> you see is done with the intent of maximising viewer appeal, and that while the public votes themselves may not be rigged, the way the candidates are portrayed to the voting public most certainly is. You <em>know</em> that the poor schmucks who audition for the shows are either too ignorant to understand what they&#8217;re letting themselves in for, or foolish enough to gamble against the house and think they can win in the long run. And you still encourage that debasement and exploitation, simply by tuning in every week.</p>
<p><strong>By watching these shows, &#8220;ironically&#8221; or otherwise, you are complicit in a form of public cruelty to other human beings.</strong> You see the ads that support the shows, see the brands that co-promote with them, watch performances by the ailing glove-puppet entertainers that are the only things left the big record labels know how to sell; <strong>your eyeballs not only validate that cruelty, but monetise it as well. </strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You are voluntarily staring at car crashes that were deliberately staged in front of billboards, and you are calling it entertainment.</strong></span></p>
<p>Ballard would be proud of his prescience.</p>
<p>Rant over.</p>

		<p>A sweeping statement, perhaps, but still: having already established that <a title="The global recession that isn't - previously on Futurismic" href="http://futurismic.com/2010/12/14/the-global-recession-that-isnt/">the &#8220;global recession&#8221; isn&#8217;t actually global</a>, there are signs that <a title="Separating Recession From Trend - Terra Nova" href="http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2010/12/separating-recession-from-trend.html"><strong>some things are still selling hard and fast here in the West. The weird bit? One of those things is access to a hyperreal virtual universe. I&#8217;m talking, of course, about <em>World Of Warcraft</em></strong>; I&#8217;ll let Edward Castronova sum it up in a few sentences</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Blizzard&#8217;s Cataclysm <a href="http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/press/pressreleases.html?101213" target="_blank">broke a single-day sales record</a> for PC games: 3.3m copies in a day. At $40 each, that&#8217;s <strong>$132m revenue in a day.</strong></p>
<p>The weekend box office for the latest Narnia move this past weekend  was $24m. The other fantasy releases like Tangled and Harry Potter, came  to $24m in their second or third week.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, granted, <em>WoW</em> was an international release, and those box office figures are (I presume) US-only. But even so, <strong>the entertainments that we value sufficiently to pay money for are changing, and changing fast&#8230; and no matter how much &#8220;can&#8217;t live without it&#8221; rhetoric you might hear from its regular users, I&#8217;m pretty sure no economist in their right mind would describe <em>WoW</em> as anything other than a leisure luxury. </strong></p>
<p>And hey &#8211; looks like <strong>Blizzard&#8217;s managing to make a pretty dime in a piracy-riddled digital world, too</strong>. How&#8217;d you like <em>them</em> apples, Hollywood?</p>

		<p>NPR&#8217;s Matt Thompson crops up at <a title="Nieman Journalism Lab" href="http://www.niemanlab.org/">NiemanLab</a>&#8216;s <a title="Predictions for Journalism 2011 - Nieman Journalism Lab" href="http://www.niemanlab.org/category/themes/predictions-2011/">&#8220;Predictions For Journalism 2011&#8243;</a> with a suggestion that&#8217;ll make the volume of the Wikileaks cable-dump look like a drop in the ocean <small>[via <a title="Univeral Instant Transcription - MetaFilter" href="http://www.metafilter.com/98570/Universal-instant-transcription">MetaFilter</a>]</small>. <strong>The nub of the theory is this: <a title="Coming soon to journalism: Matt Thompson sees the “Speakularity” and universal instant transcription - Nieman Journalism Lab" href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/12/coming-soon-to-journalism-matt-thompson-sees-the-speakularity-and-universal-instant-transcription/">pretty soon, automatic speech transcription is going to be cheap and widespread&#8230; and that means absolute masses of journalistic material will become easily and cheaply available</a>.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>So much of the raw material of journalism consists of verbal  exchanges — phone conversations, press conferences, meetings. One of  journalism’s most significant production challenges, even for those who  don’t work at a radio company, is translating these verbal exchanges  into text to weave scripts and stories out of them.</p>
<p><strong>After the Speakularity, much more of this raw material would become  available. It would render audio recordings accessible to the blind and  aid in translation of audio recordings into different languages. Obscure  city meetings could be recorded and auto-transcribed; interviews could  be published nearly instantly as Q&amp;As; journalists covering events  could focus their attention on analyzing rather than capturing the  proceedings.</strong></p>
<p>Because text is much more scannable than  audio, recordings automatically indexed to a transcript would be much  quicker to search through and edit. Jon Stewart’s crew for <em>The Daily Show</em> uses expensive  technology to process and search through the hundreds of hours of video  the various news programs air each week. Imagine if that capability were  opened up to citizens — if every on-air utterance of every pundit,  politician, or policy wonk were searchable on Google.</p></blockquote>
<p>The very first thing I can imagine would be all the Googlephobes wailing about privacy and data monopolies&#8230; but Thompson makes a valid point here, which is <strong>the potential for a disconnection between the production of the raw materials of journalism &#8211; interviews, press conferences, Q&amp;As, etc etc &#8211; from the analysis, comparison and synthesis of that material.</strong></p>
<p>Obviously that&#8217;s going to mean <strong>further job losses in the journalism sector</strong>; that production work would be done by the folk at the bottom of the office hierarchy, or so I assume, so it&#8217;s not all kittens and roses. Heck, once the tech becomes cheap and ubiquitous enough, it&#8217;ll open up the field to independent journalists and small niche venues in a way that&#8217;s never been logistically or economically sustainable before (though whether there&#8217;ll be a good way to monetise those niche verticals is another question entirely); <strong>the privileged access and momentum of the big venues will be hard to maintain, and that may lead to a fall in quality&#8230; though that will depend on how one defines quality journalism, of course, which is another open question.</strong></p>
<p>But the most important factor would be the widespread access to the raw materials &#8211; not just to journalists, but to the public. <strong>Storage is cheap, and text doesn&#8217;t eat much bandwidth; there&#8217;d be no reason not to upload the entire transcript of an interview for those who wanted to read it alongside the edited highlights and pull-quotes</strong>. Indeed, those venues that failed to make said materials available would start to look as if they had something to hide&#8230; after all, recent events suggest that transparency will become a big issue in the near future, wouldn&#8217;t you say?</p>
