                    <p class="body"><strong>As a business owner</strong> I receive 
                      countless resumes and cover letters from job seekers. Over 
                      the past twenty years I've reviewed literally hundreds of 
                      job applications.<br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>Here's a sad fact:</strong> <u>Less than one percent</u> 
                      of all the resumes I've reviewed over the years, have ever 
                      captured my interest enough where I said to myself, "Jimmy, 
                      you better call this person for an interview right now, 
                      before it's too late!"</p>
                    <p class="body"><strong>That is</strong> a <font color="#FF0000"><strong>RARITY</strong></font>. 
                      You're much more likely to spot 'Big Foot' running through 
                      the woods on your next camping trip! <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><img src="images/smile.gif" width="12" height="12"></font></p>
                    <p class="body"><strong>Even when a resume does command attention 
                      it still</strong> makes employers work way too hard trying 
                      to figure out whether they should call this person for an 
                      interview. </p>
                    <p class="body"><span class="body-highlight"><strong>One afternoon 
                      I thought to myself,</strong></span> boy would it be easy 
                      for a job-seeker to stand out from the crowd in any field 
                      and land the <u>exact job interview he or she desired</u> 
                      if only they had the <em>properly-worded </em>resume. </p>
                    <p class="body"><strong>So, one winter day I decided to write</strong> 
                      a couple of resumes <em>sprinkled</em> with some of my best 
                      "magic sales letter dust." I sat down and did just that. 
                      These resumes were fantastic and I knew they would bring 
                      in results like never before.</p>
                    <p class="body">I then selected a few job-seekers who could 
                      put these resumes to the test.</p>
                    <p class="body"><strong>The results? The only two words that 
                      matter: <em><font color="#000000">PHONE CALLS!</font></em> 
                      A big increase in job interview requests</strong>. It was 
                      exciting, but to be honest, I was not surprised.</p>
                    <p class="body"><strong>These special resumes did something 
                      most resumes don't. They actually made the <em>interview 
                      decision</em> easy for the employer!</strong> WHY? <span class="body-highlight">Because 
                      they were written with the major emphasis on getting the 
                      job-seeker called for the interview!</span></p>
                    <p class="body"><strong>The main focus was on getting employers 
                      to say to themselves,</strong> "Hmmm... you know what, I 
                      want to meet this person. I'm going to book an interview 
                      right now before another employer does."</p>
                    <p class="body"><strong>BINGO!</strong></p>
                    <p class="body">(The difference? <em>These resumes</em><em> 
                      </em><u>clearly and directly ASKED</u> for the <em>opportunity</em> 
                      to be interviewed in a way that practically forces companies 
                      to call. They'll <em>want</em> to speak with you).</p>

                    <p class="body"><strong>Two years later,</strong> I took the

                              them all over the place or even change them completely. 
                              I then made a cover letter with your Amazing Cover

                          <p>"Hi Jimmy, </p>
                          <p>My name is Bruce and I'm sending you this from New 
                            Zealand. About 3 weeks ago I downloaded your Amazing 
                            Cover Letter tool. To tell you the truth I was a bit 
                            sceptical at first but I thought 'hey, if it's no 
                            good I'll get my money<br>
                            back anyway. I hadn't had work in a little while and 
                            I was feeling a bit disheartened. I applied for a 
                            job and within a couple of days I got an interview. 
                            <span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00">At the interview 
                            they told me about 200 yes 200 people had applied 
                            and they were interviewing 12.</span> There were 3 
                            people on the panel and they told me that my covering 
                            letter jumped out and bit them. The interview went 
                            pretty good but I still wasn't done. After the interview 
                            I followed your next tip and sent them a 'Thank you 
                            for your time' letter. <span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00">Within 
                            a couple of days I got a call to say I had the job</span>. 
                            I was just stoked. I have never sent in a letter like 
                            this before but I just had to thank you for helping 
                            me "A LOT"!!! <br>
                            <br>
