My wife, Karen, agreed that this would be a noble gesture, and we did eventually bring some order to our nest. Nearly four years have passed since mounting that plate. Now we have a two-year-old son, Ronnie, who has done a fine job of restoring entropy in our household. Perhaps we can take some comfort in the fact that the term is variable.</p>

In many ways a car behaves like a soliton: It is a wave localized in a certain region of space, it keeps its shape when traveling, and it interacts with other solitons (cars) emerging unchanged, most times, perhaps with only a small phase shift.</p>
        <p>About 28 years ago, I was attending a conference at a hotel in Fort Lauderdale. During the meeting, an employee interrupted to find the owner of a car parked in a restricted spot. The employee spelled the tag S-O-L-I-T-O-N and then pronounced it. I stood up to tell the employee that I was the owner, right as a physicist in the audience said something like, &quot;A soliton at rest, parked outside? Don&rsquo;t worry, it will probably collapse and disappear rapidly.&quot; Everyone burst into laughter. As we walked toward the parking lot, I tried to explain the meaning of the word soliton to the puzzled employee.</p>

    <td><p>It&rsquo;s a lot of fun and a great conversation starter using aspects of my work as a physicist on license plates. Friends are quick to spot whenever a new one goes on the car, and invariably ask what it means. For some I provide a brief explanation, but for my weekly hiking group there is ample time to also give some background about the significance of the research. Those not familiar with Los Alamos National Laboratory are pleasantly surprised to learn that there is basic research going on in addition to work on nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>I try to come up with a new license plate every year. I am proudest of the very first one: NUCLEON, because it contains my first name. On the other hand, one wag suggested it was an invitation to nuke Leon.</p>
        <p>The operation of a high intensity proton linear accelerator at Los Alamos yielded large fluxes of pi mesons and led to PION. The advent of the quark revolution and development of a gauge theory based on the color degree of freedom, involving different flavors of quarks interacting with glue, led to a long research period and many license plates: COLOUR, FLAVOUR (British spellings), GAUGE, UP, DOWN, and GLUE. At MIT a bag model of the interaction of quarks and glue was developed, and led to BAG.</p>
        <p>QBARQ represents a meson made of a quark and anti-quark. DIMESON signifies a particle composed of two quarks and two anti-quarks. OMEGA-* is a particle comprised of three strange quarks. (An excited state is normally denoted with an asterisk, which is not available in New Mexico, but the Zia symbol is close enough.)</p>
        <p>I have about 30 plates in my basement. I&rsquo;ve kept every one, with one exception. A local restaurateur, who is also a scientist at the laboratory, recently decided to turn a portion of his restaurant into a bar, which is a place for people to meet and talk science. He named the bar Quark. I told him I had a plate by the same name and let him borrow it.</p>
        <p>A strange thing happened involving that plate back in 1975. I was driving home, and in my rear view mirror I noticed the car behind me was uncomfortably close. I could easily make out the QUARKS California plate on the front of the car. I had no doubt that the car belonged to Murray Gell-Mann, who had earlier proposed such fractionally charged particles and gave them the name that stuck. He was visiting Los Alamos that summer, but was not in the car at the time; I think his wife was behind the wheel. I was concerned about a possible collision of quarks, but fortunately no accident occurred.</p>

<p>I am an architect who invented a children's toy I call, Qubits(r) - which is patented, and the trademark is registered.  Lucky for me the Oregon plates allow 6 letters, I love fly fishing so the surcharge went to Save the Salmons. </p>

<p>Somewhat interesting side note connection for quantum buffs - In 1979 I wrote a letter to Richard Feynman describing my modular geometry and how I thought it related to quantum particles, he actually wrote a very nice letter back to me. Now that geometry is the basis for a toy that kids love to play with.</p>
