</div>

<div id="content">
	<canvas><p><strong>YOUR BROWSER CANNOT RUN THIS EXPERIMENT!</strong> It requires the use of the &lt;canvas&gt; tag, which your browser does not support. Please try viewing it with a browser like <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> or <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>.</p></canvas>
	<p>Browser Ball attempts, with only moderate success, to allow the configuration of a seemingly endless array of continuous spaces using multiple overlapping browser windows. Within this multivariate space, users are invited to toss a beach ball both hither and yon. If this sounds like a ridiculous use of everyone's time, that's only because it is.</p>
	<p>Clicking the link below spawns the main Browser Ball  window, which features two buttons:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Create Window: this will spawn a new child window. You may position and resize each window as you see fit. Browser windows that overlap will become a part of the continuous space in which the beach ball may move.</li>
		<li>Reset Ball: sometimes things get a little out of hand and the ball falls off the face of the universe. This is usually my fault. Click the reset button and you'll be okay.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The main window should also have a beach ball. Fling that puppy around. Make neat spaces for the ball to bounce around in. Create complicated layouts that may crash your browser. Have fun.</p>
	<p><a id="launch" href="#" onclick="launch()">Launch Browser Ball</a></p>

	Notes:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Browser Ball requires a JavaScript-enabled web browser that supports the &lt;canvas&gt; tag.</strong> Viable browsers include the latest versions of <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>. It will not work with any current versions of Internet Explorer.</li>
		<li>Closing or refreshing the main window will close any child windows you may have created.</li>
		<li>I make no claims as to the physical accuracy of Browser Ball. I have very, very little experience writing collision detection systems, and so, quite frequently, the ball will freak out for almost no discernable reason. All I can do is apologize profusely for my many, many shortcomings.</li>
