    <p>We get lots of emails asking us what tools we use to build our products and run our business, so I figured we&#8217;d just post it to the blog.</p>

<ul>
<li>For text editing, HTML, programming, and CSS work we use a combination of <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/index.shtml">TextWrangler</a>, <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>, and <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>.</li>
<li>For accounting we use <a href="http://quickbooks.intuit.com/commerce/catalog/product.jhtml?lid=left_nav&amp;prodId=prod0000000000007994360">Quickbooks Pro 2006 for Mac</a> (we download our statements from Chase and American Express into Quickbooks).</li>
<li>For tech support we use <a href="http://www.gmail.com">Gmail</a> and <a href="http://www.typeit4me.com/">TypeIt4Me</a>.</li>

<li>For computers we use <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">Apple Powerbooks</a> and iMac G5s (we also have a Dell for testing on the PC).</li>
<li>For our payment gateway we use <a href="http://www.authorize.net">Authorize.net</a>.</li>
<li>For our web hosting we use <a href="http://www.tilted.com">Tilted</a>.</li>
<li>For designing documents we use <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/main.html">Adobe InDesign</a>.</li>

Am not at all fond of Quicken for the Mac &#8212; financial software (imho) is one area where Mac users do suffer. </p>

<p>That said, even on the PC I&#8217;d never been a fan of Quicken and had instead been using Microsoft Money&#8217;s Small Business edition.<br />
 <br />
It&#8217;s one of the few apps they put out that I really enjoyed. Great, intuitive UI, fully customizable reports, etc. We&#8217;re now using it again on my wife&#8217;s PC. Should Apple release any Intel-based Macs that you can actually load XP on, I&#8217;ll probably do so just for this application.</p>

  <p>Good too see that there are other vim-users. I get criticts quite often because I&#8217;m using vim, but I just really don&#8217;t like using other  editors anymore. For projects at university I use Eclipse every now and then, and I can clearly see the advantages of a full-blown IDE, but too bad there&#8217;s no IDE with good vim-support.</p>

  <p>Just out of curiosity &#8212; why do you guys stick with MT and PunBB rather than building some Ruby/Rails solutions that might be more integrated and more flexible for your specific needs? Just prefer not the re-invent the wheel?</p>

<p>Not that I really care what you guys use (it&#8217;s the end product that matters), I was just curious. :)</p>

  <p>Jay: I also read tons of bad reviews of Quicken for the Mac. I went ahead and purchased it anyway, because I really needed the functionality. I&#8217;ve had almost zero problems with it since using it full time for the last two years. All of transactions are downloaded through Quicken and my accounts are balanced and transactions cleared. The UI isn&#8217;t perfect and sometimes they are a little too happy with multiple windows, but all-in-all it&#8217;s a useful and better than anything else in its class, I think.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d say you should take the plunge. I did and do not regret it.</p>

  <p><em>and Backpack helps us all stay dangerously organized</em></p>

<p>I remain curious on this one.</p>

<p>Basecamp lets you view project milestones in a calendar-style view&#8230; Backpack lets you schedule reminders&#8230; Where do you schedule/block out your time otherwise? I&#8217;ve been using a running note in Backpack to flag dates into the future that I don&#8217;t need to get a reminder for. I.e., &#8220;20060103&#8230;Mark over for dinner?&#8221; Whether it be grid-based or not, what about an actual online, easily accessed and updated calendar app?</p>

  <p><em>Why MT when Wordpress is free? Just curious I used to use MT long ago but switched to WP when MT started charging licensing fees.</em></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t believe in switching to something just because it&#8217;s free. I&#8217;m happy to reward companies that produce nice software. I have my issues with MT, but it&#8217;s served us well. Plus, the time it would take to switch over to WP and get acquainted with it isn&#8217;t free.</p>

<p>One day we may roll our own blog tool that better serves us, but we&#8217;re not going to chase this tool or that tool because one costs less than the other.</p>

  <p>I&#8217;m another satisfied user of Quicken for Mac, since about 1992. I&#8217;ve never had any serious problems with it, but it&#8217;s very lightweight compared with the Windows version. I use it only to manage my savings, checking, credit cards, and retirement accounts; I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d want to use it to manage serious investing but for these things it has worked pretty much flawlessly for me for the past 13 years.</p>

<p>PSPad editor is freeware programmer editor, usable for people who:</p>

    * need a small tool with simple controls and the capabilities of a mighty code editor<br />

  <p>Obviously you&#8217;re aware that using Gmail for commercial purposes is against the terms of the licence agreement. </p>

<p><a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/terms_of_use.html" rel="nofollow">http://mail.google.com/mail/help/terms_of_use.html</a></p>

<p>Is it a good idea to &#8216;brag&#8217; that you don&#8217;t have a proper issue tracking system in place, and are using a free web tool designed for personal use only? If Gmail is down does that mean that customers get no support? Rock solid! If I were a 37s customer I&#8217;d be looking elsewhere on that ponit alone.</p>

<p>Also, I couldn&#8217;t help noticing that you have to use another Project Mangement tool, Trac, to manage your projects. How do you decide what should be a ToDo in Basecamp and what&#8217;s a ticket in trac? Roadmap in trac, or basecamp milestones &#8230; Wiki in Trac or writeboard? Or, is it the case that Basecamp just doesn&#8217;t work that well for IT shops like yourself?</p>

  <p>jEdit is a free, powerful text editor, which runs on Macs, Windows, and Unix. It&#8217;s written in Java, and it&#8217;s quite well done. It is under active development, and there are lots of plugins to expand functionality. I prefer its Ruby tools to those in Eclipse.</p>

  <p>Anindya: We use Photoshop for the usual image stuff &#8212; icons, buttons, etc. If I want to experiment with a layout, I&#8217;ll also paste a screenshot of my current HTML mock into Photoshop and drag the parts around. &#8220;What would the tabs look like over here?

  <p>What do you use for time tracking or timesheets? Or do you guys bother with this at all, just &#8220;trusting&#8221; everyone is doing the work they should be? I mean your company looks more like a team or partnership than one with supervisors or managers.</p>

  <p>Nollind, we don&#8217;t track time. Tracking time is a waste of time. Things either get done or they don&#8217;t. If  they don&#8217;t, everyone knows about it.</p>

  <p><em>Does anyone use an app to reduce the time preparing proposals for clients?</em></p>

<p>No, but I wish I did! I tried to convince a major client of ours to let us build a bespoke client proposal system rather than spending 4 times the amount on a commercial system. They went with the commercial because they could put down license costs in the accounts rather than a lump sum of development costs! stupid&#8230;</p>

<p>How do you use Trac to manage multiple products? I like what I have demoed and read about Trac, but not having multiple Project capability (without some fancy Apache configuration or smart use of the Component entity) is a showstopper.</p>

  <p>Mike, for text editing, i prefer TextPad. it&#8217;s amazing, free, and very very customizable. it&#8217;ll highlight any and all syntax you want highlighted, for each language you specify etc.</p>

  <p>I just bought and downloaded Quicken 2006 for Mac and I am very upset with how it doesn&#8217;t work with my brokerage accounts like Ameritrade or Etrade.  The last time I had used Quicken for Mac was from software I had from 2000.  In this area it hasn&#8217;t changed at all. I had figured that in 5 - 6 years it would have made the improvements in this area.  Not so.  I sent an email to Intuit to see if I can get a refund (not likely).  Maybe they will come up with a solution (again - not likely).  It works fine on a PC.  My PC crapped out - so unless I get another  - I guess that I will have to do without.  And if I get a PC then I may just try Money instead.  I guess that Microsoft isn&#8217;t likely to come out with a Mac version.  Now if I am all wet - please offer a solution - and I will gladly eat my words.    </p>
