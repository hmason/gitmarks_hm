    <p>I bet a lot of your are thinking about building your own web app. But how do you get started if you have no idea what it&#8217;s going to cost you? How can you budget for the unknown?</p>

<p>I recently did a talk at <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com/summit">The Future of Web Apps</a> in London (one of our <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com/">Carson Workshops</a> events), focusing specifically on this issue. The feedback I received was very positive, so I&#8217;ve decided to share it with you all.</p>

<p>You can also <a href="http://www.webuser.co.uk/carsonworkshops/RyanCarson.mp3">listen to the MP3</a> and <a href="http://www.webuser.co.uk/carsonworkshops/RyanCarson.pdf">grab the notes</a>, but for those of you who don&#8217;t have time to listen to the 45 minute talk, I&#8217;m going to summarise here.</p>


    <div id="a000969more"><div id="more">
      <h3>What does it actually cost?</h3>

<p>When we built <a href="http://www.dropsend.com">DropSend</a>, it was our first enterprise level web app and I had no way to predict how much it would cost to build. Frustratingly, no one would share their figures with me either. So we had to learn the hard way. Yuck. </p>

<p>In order to help you avoid this pain, I&#8217;m going to walk you through, step-by-step, the costs involved in building an enterprise web app, on a budget. I&#8217;m going to be 100% honest about what we spent so you&#8217;ll have a good idea of what kind of budget you&#8217;ll need to set. </p>

<h3>What&#8217;s the big deal? </h3>

<p>Why is it only recently that small companies (Carson Systems is only two full time employees and a set of 3 part-time freelancers) are able to build large scale web apps? Here&#8217;s why:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Broadband is widespread so your potential audience is larger</li>
    <li>Average people are comfortable with web apps (Gmail, Online banking, etc)</li>
    <li>Hardware is dirt cheap</li>
    <li>Open source platforms are virtually free</li>
</ol>

<h3>Definition of the terms </h3>

<p>As I&#8217;m talking about &quot;Building enterprise web apps on a budget&quot;, I need to define two things: </p>

<ol>
    <li>&quot;Enterprise&quot; - This is debatable, but I&#8217;d define it as a mass market product for 1,000+ users</li>
    <li>&quot;On a budget&quot; - Under &pound;30,000</li>
</ol>

<p>I&#8217;ve heard some comments about my &pound;30K figure not being &quot;on a budget&quot;. Please keep in mind that this article is aimed at small companies, not freelancers. Most small companies will be able to allocate &pound;30K, over a period of time. It may be possible to bring an enterprise web app to market for less than this, but it will probably be lacking in quality.</p>

<h3>DropSend - Enterprise and on a budget</h3>

<p>I&#8217;d better know what I&#8217;m talking about, if I&#8217;m offering advice, right?! Well, all of this advice is based on us building <a href="http://www.dropsend.com">DropSend</a>, a truly enterprise level web app that was built on a budget: Here&#8217;s a bit about it:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Used for sending and storing large files that you can&#8217;t email </li>
    <li>13,083 worldwide users (March 6, 2006) and growing</li>
    <li>6 servers at 365 Main</li>
    <li>Desktop apps which use our API</li>
    <li>Built using PHP, AJAX, MySQL and Linux</li>
</ul>

<h3>The most important thing</h3>

<p>Before you get started, the most important thing is to <strong>make sure your idea is financially viable</strong>. How can you do this?</p>

<ol>
    <li>Use common sense. Would you actually get out your credit card and pay for it?</li>
    <li>Be cautious about your projections and then cut by a further 45%. Are you still in business?</li>
    <li>Don&#8217;t rely on being acquired. It&#8217;s unwise to base your financial future on something you have zero control over. (In other words, it&#8217;s stupid.)</li>
</ol>

<h3>What we actually spent</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Branding and UI design: &pound;5,000 - We worked with <a href="http://www.mutado.com">Ryan Shelton</a> on this. He&#8217;s amazing.<br />
    </li>
    <li> Development: &pound;8,500 - We worked with <a href="http://www.plumdigitalmedia.com/">Plum Digital Media</a>, who are crazy talented developers.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Mac and PC desktop apps: &pound;2,750<br />
    </li>
    <li>XHTML and CSS: &pound;1,600<br />
    </li>
    <li>Misc hardware: &pound;500<br />
    </li>
    <li>Hosting and maintenance: &pound;900 per month - We work with <a href="http://www.bitpusher.com/">BitPusher</a> for all of our hardware infrastructure and maintenance. I can&#8217;t recommend them enough. They helped us define the hardware architecture, procure the boxes, install, and set everything up. Now that we&#8217;re up and running, they do all our hardware maintenance.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Legal fees: &pound;2,630<br />
    </li>
    <li>Accounting: &pound;500<br />
    </li>
    <li>Linux specialist to setup the dev box: &pound;500<br />
    </li>
    <li>Misc: &pound;1,950<br />
    </li>
    <li>Trademark: &pound;250<br />
    </li>
    <li>Merchant Account: &pound;200<br />
    </li>
    <li>Payment Processor: &pound;500 - We use <a href="http://securetrading.net/">Secure Trading</a> - they&#8217;re fab!<br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>Total: &pound;25,780 (Approx $45,000 USD)</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Yikes. &pound;25,780? </h3>

<p>If you&#8217;re a small company and &pound;26K sounds like a lot of money, don&#8217;t despair. You will be able to spread these costs out over many months. If you don&#8217;t have that kind of cash right now, don&#8217;t feel bad. It took us almost a year to get the financial stability and save the cash for DropSend.</p>

<h3>How to build your team on a budget</h3>

<p>One of the most expensive parts to building a web app is the team. Here are some of our tips for keeping your costs down:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Don&#8217;t go for rock stars - go for quiet talent. They&#8217;re cheaper, more fun to work with, and they&#8217;ll actually listen to you.</li>
    <li>If someone is too expensive, but you <em>really</em> want to work with them, offer them 2 - 5% of the product equity in exchange for a cheaper price. </li>
    <li>Ask your friends to recommend people they trust. If you pick a bad apple, it will cost you time and money.</li>
    <li>Outsource. We tried India initially, and it proved to be a disaster. I think this was because I had never managed a project long-distance before. If you already feel comfortable with this, it can save you <em>tons</em> of money.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Scalability on a budget </h3>

<p>One of the trickiest parts of building an enterprise web app on a budget, is scaling. How can you start with a little bit of hardware/capacity/CPU/backup and scale infinitely?</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;d recommend: Don&#8217;t start worrying about that until you have to. If you throw a bunch of money at the problem and your app fails, you might as well have burned the cash at the race track.</p>

<p>For DropSend, we almost bought a bunch of IBM Blades and hooked them up to SAN storage. I&#8217;m SO glad we didn&#8217;t go this route. </p>

<p>So here are three basic tips regarding scalability on a budget:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Buy just enough hardware to launch</li>
    <li>Build your app so it easily scales. DropSend is a great example of this. When we need more diskspace, we just add a line to the config file, plug in another box, re-deploy, and BAM, we&#8217;ve got more diskspace. </li>
    <li>Plan for scaling, but don&#8217;t obsess</li>
</ol>

<h3>Next time &#8230;</h3>

<p>In Part 2 of this article, I&#8217;ll be covering:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Tips for staying on budget</li>
    <li>The importance of pessimism</li>
    <li>Budgets for legal costs</li>
    <li>How to save money with free tools</li>
    <li>How to do marketing for free</li>
    <li>Why venture capital doesn&#8217;t usually make sense for web apps </li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks for reading. I hope we&#8217;ve saved you some of the pain and suffering we went through when we built DropSend. On a side note, I&#8217;ve just finished 37signals new book <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real</a>, and it&#8217;s got some more excellent ideas on how to build on a budget. </p>

<p>As always, feel free to agree or disagree below. See you next time! </p>

  <p>Great post! $45k does seem a little steep for a web app, but I have never launched an &#8220;enterprise&#8221; level service before, so I speak from ignorance.</p>

<p>The costs for my startup <a href="http://www.indiefy.com" rel="nofollow">Indiefy.com</a>, which will be launching this summer are no where near $45k, but the system will be able to handle 1,000+ users. I assume my costs are lower because I did all design/development myself.</p>

<p>Anyways great advice/article. Thanks!</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing your costs and lessons learned in public. I can&#8217;t wait for part 2. Given that it seems like you outsourced almost everything from programming to UI design, could you give a little background on what your role was in creating DropSend? Are you the founder/product visionary?</p>

<p>It seems like a lot of other firms assemble a team, consult, and then make products (like 37 signals itself). I wonder if there&#8217;s any particular advice you could give in finding and evaluating talent?</p>

  <p>Hey Jason,</p>

<p>Yes, I&#8217;m the founder of Carson Systems and DropSend. My wife and I are the Directors.</p>

<p>The reason we outsourced everything to freelancers is because we were too small to bring people on full time.</p>

<p>However, we&#8217;re now getting so busy that we&#8217;ll be hiring our first full-time developer. Scary! :)</p>

<p>Best,<br />

  <p>Ryan, would you mind elaborating on a few of your line items?  The cost for Mac and PC desktop apps&#8230; are those the DropSend desktop components development costs or actual software that you had to purchase in order to build DropSend?</p>

<p>Thanks for the great tips. I&#8217;m very interested in what your legal fees and trademark cover and how you came to the decision about what legal services you needed. I think this is grey area that I&#8217;d like to learn more about - especially how it pertains to the startup/running of web apps.</p>

<p>We are in no way connected to Plum Digital Media. They simply built the backend to DropSend, and that&#8217;s it. I&#8217;m not sure why they&#8217;ve listed us as &#8216;partners&#8217;.</p>

  <p>Thanks so much for sharing, Ryan. This is really, really helpful for a presentation I&#8217;m going to make to exec of my company in a week or so.</p>

<p>BTW, you said above that sharing your revenues would be giving too much away to your competitors. To be really honest, I think that sharing your costs shows WAY more.</p>

<p>They can find out your revenues easily enough by pretending to be customers and signing up for your service, or pestering you for free trials to try to gauge how often you give away free accounts.</p>

  <p>@ Brian Sweeting - I reckon Ryan would have stayed out of development because he was the project manager. If you get involved in the details its too easy to lose sight of the rest of the project. Ryan had his own vision and was probably best that he stayed at the helm and outsourced the work to someone else, that way he could still see what is going on and act as quality control&#8230;.worth considering next time you have a large project.</p>

  <p>Ryan,</p>

<p>Coincidentally, I just finished listening to the podcast of your presentation this morning. I am listening to the other presenters right now and have really enjoyed them all so far. Thank you very much for making these available (free is great, but I bet you could get away with a small fee if you wanted).</p>

<p>I am a full time developer with some side projects that I do mostly for fun, but hope that maybe some day they could be a source of income. You definitely opened my mind with your real-world examples and I appreciate it very much. I had not at all considered the high costs of legal matters- I say the costs are high because I am guessing that they do not really scale with the size of the project.</p>

<p>I had also never given much real consideration to outsourcing since I can do the majority of the work myself, but when I think about all the time I could free up… maybe that is a necessary step to launch a serious application that could actually be profitable.</p>

<p>Lots to think about… but thanks again!<br />

  <p>Ryan,</p>

<p>I listened to your presentation (as well as the all the others offered) a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p>I must commend you on the excellent job that all of you did - your candor, insight and general ability to fire the imagination are unique and refreshing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d recommend all reading here to download the full mp3&#8217;s from the workshop.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a user of dropsend, as I don&#8217;t currently have that particular need, but I certainly spread the word whenever I get the chance. That alone I hope has resulted in a least one sale for you; ensuring you continue your current open approach in the future!</p>

<p>Great Job, and good luck to your company!</p>

  <p>I&#8217;d be careful with the definition of &#8220;Enterprise web app&#8221;. You&#8217;ve described a process of building an app from scratch and with a full freedom of choice of technologies. What&#8217;s called &#8220;enterprise&#8221; is usually mid-size or bigger companies with a lot of bull such as inefficiency, heavy standards, meetings and such. As result things will end up much more expensive for the enterprise</p>

  <p>Ryan,</p>

<p>I wonder if you might be able to break out the hosting side of things?  I&#8217;m curious how far £900 gets you in rough terms of bandwidth, hardware, and maintenance, especially at at 365 Main.  Are you renting hardware from BitPusher or leasing it yourself?</p>

<p>Thanks,<br />
James<br />

  <p>Bear in mind it&#8217;s no problem to pull off a (profitable) Web 2.0 app a lot more cheaply than this. The Carson numbers seem to assume no in-house talent for coding or design, and while a company like 37signals has to pay salaries, if you (and/or a group of likeminded people) are willing to treat it as your own startup, you won&#8217;t necessarily need to pay £X,XXX to hire external developers and designers.</p>

<p>Also £900 per month for hosting is on the high end even for a semi-popular app, but considering DropSend does an absolute ton of bandwidth with all the file transfers, is an edge case. It&#8217;s quite viable to run a pretty busy application off of one or two boxes at between $200-$300 per month at a dedicated server company with no initial outlay.</p>

<p>So, if you haven&#8217;t got $45K don&#8217;t despair.. you can make up that $45K with in-house talent, time, and being smart with your infrastructure.</p>

  <p>I agree that people shouldn&#8217;t be frightened by $45k. That&#8217;s a totally achievable figure.</p>

<p>But when folks start saying &#8220;just do it yourself and don&#8217;t pay yourself&#8221; keep in mind that you gotta eat/pay rent as well (presumably).</p>

<p>The $45k just gets you up and running faster because you&#8217;re not working on it during weekends/nights etc. And because there is money being spent you treat it as more than a hobby.</p>

<p>Thanks very much for sharing all this with us!</p>

  <p>Ryan, I went the India route and launched my app for roughly $8500, most of it going to the design work.</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t wait to read Part 2, marketing is what I&#8217;m finding to be the most difficult part of the process so far.  It&#8217;s easy to think that once you launch the app, people will automatically know that it&#8217;s there.</p>

  <p>I suggest people work on their app on the side. Keep your day job while you build the app. That&#8217;s what we did with Basecamp. The time and money constraints will force you into making more focused decisions.</p>

  <p>I would love to see the software/hardware architecture if its avaialable.  The app I am working on has a similar disk space issue (it involves people&#8217;s photos) and I&#8217;ve been looking around at a bunch of solutions.  Right now I&#8217;m leaning towards mounting the webserver&#8217;s root via NFS and storing the archived copies of the files on a few PCs with Mogile FS on them.  </p>

<p>Anyway - would love to hear how you&#8217;ve tackled the disk space problem.  Thanks again for posting this stuff, its pure gold.<br />

<p>Thanks, for the support.  My secret is rentacoder.com.  If anyone is interested in my story and how I managed my three overseas freelancers you can read my <a href="http://www.rentacoder.com/RentACoder/Press/SourcingMag/IWasANewbieToProjectOutsourcing/I%20Was%20a%20Newbie%20to%20Project%20Outsourcing.htm" rel="nofollow">SourcingMag.com Post</a></p>

<p>JF -</p>

<p>I agree 100%.  Keeping your &#8220;real job&#8221; while acting as project manager to your outsourced individuals is by far the best way to go.  Just make sure your company won&#8217;t claim rights to your product once you&#8217;re in the black.</p>

  <p>Ryan: </p>

<p>This is a great article - something we practice all the time. </p>

<p>I was really intrigued to see you say &#8220;Don’t go for rock stars - go for quiet talent.&#8221; This is SO true and yet you always hear people preaching hire the smartest of them all. I think while there is definite merit in that, practically you really do not need every member to be the smartest. Sometimes the quiter, tier 2 folks are a lot more easy to work with, lot more focused, willing to learn, don&#8217;t waste time on meaningless technical arguments and really can &#8220;listen&#8221;. We have had great success with this approach and I hope others start to see this difference as well. </p>

<p>Also, your India experience rang a bell too. I have heard it from others but most times I have seen that the problem occurred mainly due to mis-match of skills, project management and understanding of the criticality of milestones etc. We ourselves have a super savvy tech team in Pune, India and with a Bay Area and India combination we have seen that your are able to iron out the issues and really leverage the economics of costs and time in a big way. Next time you want to give it a shot, feel free to drop me a note. If you can make offshore work (and it is working great for a number of companies), the 45K USD will further reduce drastically which just makes it a whole lot easier and affordable. </p>

<p>I will look forward to the next part of this post. Good luck with DropSend. </p>

  <p>LukeP - The legal costs I mentioned (Terms of Service, contracts for your freelancers and a privacy policy) are the bare minimum for any web app. The trademark isn&#8217;t necessary, but it&#8217;s always wise. It&#8217;s expensive to get a world-wide trademark, so we just went for UK for now.</p>

<p>Geoff Gill - DropSend took us about 9 months from idea to real-world.</p>

<p>Alex Reuter - It&#8217;s 900 *pounds* not dollars per month. This covers hardware rental (we didn&#8217;t have to lease - hooray!) and maintenance.</p>

<p>Dave P - Thanks for the kind words! :)</p>

<p>James - Best to call BitPusher (they&#8217;re super friendly) to get the specifics. I know we got a very good deal.</p>

<p>Vaibhav - Thanks for the insight on outsourcing the code. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll go that route again (we&#8217;re hiring our first full-time developer this month), but if we do, I&#8217;ll give you a shout.</p>

<p>Jason - Good point. I should&#8217;ve mentioned that the very first app Carson Systems built, was done by me, while I still had a day job. As I&#8217;m not a great programmer though, it was a little lacking in quality :)</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t outsource Branding. Your designers need to have the cultural sensitivities of the target market. You can&#8217;t get that offshore.</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t outsource legal matters either.</p>

<p>And outsourcing would cut 75% of the USD 45k? What if the developers were paying their client to do the work&#8230; Perhaps.</p>

  <p>Just want to stress how different your situation is from that of a company with a legacy.<br />
I run a &#8220;web 1.0.&#8221; survivor company.<br />
Because of our legacy (old code, old practices etc) and the fact that local developers in Scandinavia charge USD 120 per hour your USD 45 000 would get us nowhere.</p>

  <p>Great Post Ryan. </p>

<p>What did you wanted parimarily: </p>

<p>1. The product to meet a fix budget ? or. <br />
2. The product to have all the features ? or, <br />
3. The product to be developed in a specific timeline?</p>

<p>I was recently involved in a product development effort that was ad &#8220;boot strapped&#8221; as it can be and we basically started with following:</p>

<p>1. The most critical features that the product must have in order for us to sell it.</p>

<p>2. Maximum budget can we allocate for this </p>

<p>Did you had to make such features vs cost decisions? I guess they are the soul of the matter for all companies that are trying to make something with a limited &#8220;boot strapping&#8221; budget. </p>

<p>So I would say that a sensible businessman cannot budget for the unknown and if they can it wont be boot-strapping. </p>

  <p>Very nice details. Thanks for the inspiration.  Just a terminology nit to pick.  I agree that you have built an &#8220;Enterprise Scale&#8221; product, especially if you have back end management tools to track usage, load, etc.  But it is not an &#8220;enterprise product&#8221; An enterprise product is one sold to and used by enterprises. If you sold your whole set up for enterprises (think BT) to use internally *that* would be an enterprise product.  </p>

  <p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but w/o a version control system, even if you are 2-5 person company, u will be dead in the water! hell, I know one person companies utilizing version control effectively!</p>

<p>now, task management might seem like a huge deal, but if you look around, there are really cool nifty easy to use applications out there: backpack and fogbugz for example if you are a 2 person company.</p>

<p>If you guys don&#8217;t use these systems and e&#8217;thing works great for you, well and good. but for the vast majority of projects, you will need these systems to have any sort of scalability.</p>

<p>I hate to throw it on you, but you are that &#8220;trendy couple sipping Chardonnay&#8221;. What would you say is your added value?</p>

  <p>Chad, Neo has a very good point. While CRM and TMS are needed only on some scale, <em>professional</em> software developers use source control system even for their own pet projects and code snippets, let alone project involving more than one person. Not using source control system in that case is downright stupid.</p>

  <p>Very interesting <br /><br />
I think this has been the best thing for me to have read today<br /><br />
I have started creating components and applications for the Joomla CMS.  Zero budget,   I mean it! <br /><br />
I outsourced a coder from Russia, brilliant guy,  who built the 1st application and charged me $30 and the 2nd one $40.  We got 1000 downloads from 300 registered users.<br /><br />
A guy from sweden whose wife is on the design team for volvo has taken the responsibilty logo/template design for free.<br /><br />
A coder from slovakia will secure all the components and make them xhtml compliant for free <br />.<br />
a copywriter from USA will be writing future ad copies for exchange of my next component (free version to be released this week).<br /><br />
So far I have spent $500 dollars and got back $700, the 1st 2 components were distributed free! The 3rd (taken offline for security fixes) brought in the $700.<br /><br />
The current application in development is going to be awesome<br /><br />
The point here is, I foresee doing a major app that is going to be used globally, and will cost me a lot of money; but by the time I reach that stage the internet will be expecting it from me!  <br /><br />
What have  I got to lose setting my goals high.   I am in debt 15k (that sterling), but great information in the article, I lot I can use and has stregthened my goals and objectives and put some perspective.  I hope I am able to seek guidance and help from Ryan, as long as it is under $20 :)</p>
