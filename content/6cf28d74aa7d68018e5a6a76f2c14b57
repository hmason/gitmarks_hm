project turned into such a big one costing double and taking three times the length you estimated? Many of you will say <strong>estimating time for web projects accurately</strong> is an oxymoron, but by applying a few effective techniques it&#8217;s possible to dramatically increase the accuracy of most web project estimates.</p><h3>1. Why Underestimating Is So Common</h3><p>There are several reasons, which are freely admitted amongst freelancers and web agencies, as to why web projects are so commonly underestimated &#8211; they include:</p><ul><li>The technologies required by the project have never been used before</li><li>At the time of estimating, there are grey areas or complete unknowns</li><li>The client operates in a specialized industry and the solution needs bespoke features that are not familiar to the supplier</li><li>Splitting the project down into the detail would require as much as work as the requirements gathering phase that is chargeable</li></ul><p><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/images/estimation-project-management/top-secret.jpg" alt="Top-secret in Effective Strategy To Estimate Time For Your Design Projects" width="445" height="210" /></p><p>However, there are also some <strong>secret reasons</strong> why web projects are commonly underestimated:</p><ul><li>The client needs an estimate for their project tomorrow or they will go elsewhere</li><li>Revenue needs for cash flow now trump the effects of not winning the new work now</li><li>No previous project &#8216;estimated vs. actual&#8217; data analysis has been conducted to draw on</li><li>Estimating time for a project is not fun</li></ul><p>Despite being true, rarely do we admit these reasons to others or even ourselves! The fact is, when working as a web professional, as a one man band or as part of a small busy web team, the secret reasons are an everyday reality that shouldn&#8217;t be hidden away.</p><p>By first <strong>identifying and admitting why underestimating is so common</strong>, can you then set about implementing changes to your estimating process that will reduce the barriers each reason creates and increase your accuracy.</p><h4>Technologies Not Used Before</h4><p>There are <strong>three approaches</strong> you can take when confronted with a brief that requires a technology you have minimal experience with:</p><ol><li>Negotiate a paid for functional specification phase as a first step</li><li>Consider hiring an expert</li><li>Research in your own time and make your best guess</li></ol><p>Try to negotiate with the client a mini-project where you are paid to conduct a research and functional planning stage before committing to the whole project. This way you can research the unfamiliar technology and deliver a functional specification to the client.</p><p><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/images/estimation-project-management/estim.jpg" alt="Estim in Effective Strategy To Estimate Time For Your Design Projects" width="450" height="301" /></p><p><strong>Best case scenario</strong><br /> You give the client confidence, have a much clearer understanding of the work required, re-estimate and are hired for the rest of the project.</p><p><strong>Worst case</strong><br /> You have completed foundation learning of a technology you previously didn&#8217;t know that you can sell to new clients, you generate revenue and the client has a comprehensive specification they can use in their tender process.</p><p><strong>Added bonus</strong><br /> You, and the client, get to find out how you work together, giving both the opportunity to part company before being locked into a lengthy project.</p><p>If you&#8217;re not able to convince the client to pay for this initial functional planning stage, and can&#8217;t find a suitable expert in the technology, but want the work and have confidence in your ability and passion to learn what needs to be learnt, then the best advice is to do some initial research in your own time and just take your best guess!</p><h4>Estimating Takes Too Long</h4><p>Thorough web project estimating takes time, but it tends to inherit all the same rules that apply to coding, <strong>the more thorough you are, the more accurate you&#8217;ll be</strong>.</p><p>Is it possible you will spend time working out the features required only to learn you haven&#8217;t won the work? Will you have given the client a free and detailed breakdown of their project for free? Absolutely, but this is the just nature of sales, some you win, some you lose &#8211; don&#8217;t get disheartened, try to get feedback from the client on why you didn&#8217;t win and use the advice given to refine your next estimation.</p><h4>Estimate Is Needed Tomorrow</h4><p>If a client is <strong>demanding an estimate tomorrow</strong> after briefing you on the project today you should immediately try to assess if the project is right for you by:</p><ol><li>Determining if the response rate being demanded by the client, and any previous communication, is a sign of the type of client they will be to work with</li><li>Assessing if the potential gain to your business from the project (high profile client or long-term repeat business) is worth the risk of underestimating and going over budget</li><li>Trying to confirm a ball park budget range with the client so you can estimate realistically, or politely decline if far too low. The best kind of clients are experienced enough to know this is not someone looking to use up all their hard earned cash but someone looking to provide the best solution they can for the budget</li></ol><p>If the results of these quick steps are favorable, <strong>be positive and go for it!</strong> There will be another chance to decline if you later find out the project is not right for you, and then you may utter the words <em>&#8220;Into the garbage chute, flyboy!&#8221;</em></p><p><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/images/estimation-project-management/estimation.jpg" alt="Estimation in Effective Strategy To Estimate Time For Your Design Projects" width="450" height="333" /></p><h4>Cash Flow Dilemma</h4><p>Cash flow is the life blood of any freelancer or small web agency, without they don&#8217;t survive.</p><p>Occasionally a situation may arise where work will be taken on with the knowledge it may not be profitable. As gut wrenching as this can be, and despite all the comments you will hear how you should never do this, <strong>the reality is the bills and wages have to be paid!</strong></p><p>When a freelancer or business owner is presented with the choice of committing to a project for a price they know is low, but by taking on the project means they live to fight another month, or risking not taking on the work on in the hope more profitable leads appear &#8211; empathise with and respect them.</p><p>It is a <strong>tough and gutsy decision</strong> that only they can make but rest assured they have their bills or your wages at the forefront of their mind when they make it and estimating low for a project isn&#8217;t always as naive a decision as it may appear to those not on the frontline.</p><h4>Estimating Is Not Fun</h4><p>Ok, so it&#8217;s not as sexy as adding that beautiful grunge effect to your design, and it&#8217;s not as exciting as tweaking that jQuery plugin to work just the way you want, but estimating time for a web project more accurately is almost certainly <strong>more important than both</strong> when it comes to sustaining a freelance or small web agency business.</p><p>However, while few will disagree as to its importance, many will continually find it difficult to muster up the passion and diligently estimate time for a web project, but why!? Here are more <strong>secret reasons</strong>:</p><ul><li>It&#8217;s hard work and takes many outside their comfort zone</li><li>Estimating usually has to be completed alongside your plans for your already fully booked week</li><li>It forces you to try and predict the future</li><li>It makes you largely responsible for the business&#8217;s sales success, solution offered, project profitability and growth and survival of your business (scary stuff!)</li></ul><p>Web agencies often have the edge here because they will have dedicated salespeople or project managers who are used to the rigors of estimating, but freelancers will generally be more inclined to find the whole process rather boring and just want to get on with the fun stuff.</p><p>While we can all no doubt empathise with this, the harsh truth is that, when running a small business or operating as a one man band, <strong>one or two badly estimated projects in quick succession can ultimately lead to the demise of both!</strong></p><p>So what other techniques can be used to further increase the accuracy of your estimates?</p><h3>2. Consistent Project Phases And Tasks</h3><p>As previously mentioned, when being asked to provide an estimate for a project, it is invariably not something anyone has allocated time to do. As a result of this, estimates are often put together quickly and if compared to past estimates it&#8217;s not uncommon to see the same project phase or task classified in many different ways, and for similar sized projects the estimates for each to be completely different.</p><p class="showcase"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/images/estimation-project-management/wbs.jpg" alt="Wbs in Effective Strategy To Estimate Time For Your Design Projects" width="445" height="210" /></p><p>If you win the work you may think &#8220;so what?&#8221;, and to some extent you would be right, however, the first step in creating more accurate estimates on a long-term basis is to always <strong>break down the project phases and tasks in a consistent manner</strong>. Web projects can generally be broken down into the following phases:</p><ul><li>Research and planning</li><li>Solution design</li><li>Design</li><li>Front-end development</li><li>Back-end development</li><li>Content entry</li><li>Testing</li><li>Go-live</li></ul><p>By always beginning to compile estimates using a consistent high-level breakdown means you can have a re-usable template eventually and track the time spent on each.</p><p>But don&#8217;t stop there! Consistently breaking each phase down further will not only increase the accuracy of the estimate, but again, also result in valuable data over time.</p><h3>3. Getting Granular</h3><p class="showcase"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/images/estimation-project-management/getting-granular.jpg" alt="Getting-granular in Effective Strategy To Estimate Time For Your Design Projects" width="445" height="210" /></p><p>Now the project estimate is broken down into high-level phases, it&#8217;s time to get more granular and break each phase into tasks. This is where the estimate begins to become more tailored to the specific project, but also includes common tasks that you can add to your estimating template and use again and again. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Research and planning</strong><ul><li>Requirements gathering</li><li>Project planning</li></ul></li><li><strong>Solution design</strong><ul><li>Sitemap</li><li>Wireframes</li><li>User workflows</li><li>Functional specification</li></ul></li><li><strong>Design</strong><ul><li>Initial homepage look and feel</li><li>Content page</li><li>Master content page template</li><li>News main page</li><li>News item</li></ul></li><li><strong>Front-end development</strong><ul><li>5x Templates build XHTML/CSS</li><li>JavaScript and AJAX</li><li>Cross-browser fixes</li></ul></li><li><strong>Back-end development</strong><ul><li>CMS Setup and configuration</li><li>News feature</li><li>Contact us form</li></ul></li><li><strong>Content entry</strong><ul><li>Homepage copy</li><li>Addition of 10x News items</li></ul></li><li><strong>Testing</strong><ul><li>Internal functional testing</li><li>Client User Acceptance Testing (UAT)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Go-live</strong><ul><li>Live server setup</li><li>301 re-directs from old site URLs to new</li></ul></li></ul><p>The page templates and features specific to the client&#8217;s project can be listed at this stage, alongside the tasks required in all web projects.</p><p>Once you get into the habit of compiling estimates in this way you will find yourself envisaging the phase and tasks lists during the pre-sales initial communication with the client and this invariably:</p><ol><li><strong>Refines your requirements gathering skills</strong> to quickly get the information you need in order to put together a thorough estimate</li><li><strong>Forces you to think the project through</strong> in a step-by-step fashion and minimises the chances of missing a large, or several small, tasks that could end up putting you over budget because you didn&#8217;t factor them in</li></ol><p>So, you now have a pretty solid phase and task list for the project and all that&#8217;s left is to estimate hours for each and send it off to the client right? Maybe, but wait, what exactly does the News feature consist of? Is your interpretation of a News feature the same as the client&#8217;s?</p><p><strong>Now is the time to investigate and define it</strong>, as opposed to after the contracts have been signed.</p><h4>Getting More Granular</h4><p>While it&#8217;s tempting to estimate hours for the News feature and submit to the client, if possible, try to nail down exactly what the client wants from this feature at the estimating stage, after all, if you look around, you&#8217;ll be able to quickly find different variations of the same feature that have a huge differences in terms of size, features and complexity, and thus cost.</p><p>Using the News feature as an example, talk to the client and determine what it needs to do so that you can again minimise the chances of missing something in your estimate that could, when added to the other &#8216;small&#8217; missed tasks, amount to a <strong>serious budget overrun situation</strong>.</p><p>You may find out the News feature requirements are:</p><ul><li><strong>News feature</strong><ul><li>Add/edit/delete news item</li><li>Upload image</li><li>Attach PDF</li><li>Auto-archiving</li><li>RSS</li></ul></li></ul><p>Excellent, you have now defined the News feature and can confidentially estimate the time you think it will take to implement. But <strong>hidden in even the most basic and common of features</strong> lay more &#8216;small&#8217; things that if not captured, considered and quoted on, can add to the likelihood of overrun.</p><p>For example, the client has specified they need to be able to upload images to news items, but do they need any of the following:</p><ul><li>Auto-resize capability?</li><li>Auto-thumbnail generation?</li><li>Full-screen viewing?</li><li>Caption addition facility?</li></ul><p>Any of the above News features could add a few hours to the overall project and thus need to be ideally catered for in your estimates &#8211; a few missed &#8216;couple of hours&#8217; tasks and suddenly the project is two days over budget.</p><p><strong>Getting granular</strong> and <strong>mentally trying to build the solution</strong> means you are able to identify and address these issues early on, making sure to cater for them in your final estimate.</p><p><em>&#8220;A Web Project Manager knows how to design and develop most of the project on his own, even if with poorer results compared to his team. This allows him to estimate projects with good approximation and to understand his team&#8217;s problems and difficulties&#8221;</em></p><p><a href="http://www.fucinaweb.com/en/introduction-to-web-project-management">Introduction to Web Project Management, Antonio Volpon</a></p><h4>Advantages Of Getting Granular, For You And The Client</h4><p>By getting granular with project phases and tasks for estimates you are also able to tweak them very quickly if you discover the estimate you have submitted is above the client&#8217;s maximum budget.</p><p>For example, how often have you been told by a client they want to go with you but your quote is <em>&#8216;just a little too high&#8217;</em> and <em>&#8216;if you could reduce it by five hours we can business&#8217;</em>? Usually this means you have to do one of two things; drop the hours you estimated for the News feature and hope you can explain later down the line how the budget does not allow for image uploads and thumbnail generation etc., or remove the News feature altogether.</p><p>But, if you have a granular estimate for the News feature, you can <strong>confidentially</strong>, and at this <strong>crucial expectation setting stage</strong>, simply remove a couple of sub-features of News and the News image upload functionality in order to align with the client&#8217;s budget.</p><p>When communicating this to the client they will clearly see what you are proposing to drop and why and they will still get the News feature they need, but perhaps with a few less nice to haves. Using this approach is usually well received by clients as they have full and transparency on the reasoning behind the changes to your proposal.</p><p>This kind of transparency during the sales process will invariably <strong>give the client confidence in you</strong> because it demonstrates to them you:</p><ol><li>Are an expert in your field</li><li>Can envisage the project in its entirety</li><li>Adopt a diligent and methodical approach and more than likely will continue to work this way on their project</li></ol><p>Best of all, if you are successful with your estimate and you are hired you already have the foundations of:</p><ol><li>An instant statement of work</li><li>A defined project scope</li><li>The timings you need to put together an accurate project schedule with milestones</li><li>Client expectations settings very early</li><li>Demonstrated your thoroughness and understanding of their business and requirements to the client</li></ol><p><strong>So what now?</strong> Well, now you have won the work, it&#8217;s time to start collecting the data that will enable you to create even more accurate estimates in the future.</p><h3>4. Consistent Time Tracking And Analysis</h3><p>Before starting the work, you should first <strong>replicate all of the phases and tasks</strong>, along with their time estimates, <strong>into your time tracking tool</strong> of choice. Once this is done, you can then begin work and make sure to be disciplined and track everything you do and log it under the right category.</p><p class="showcase"><a href="http://tickspot.com"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/images/estimation-project-management/tickspot-timer.jpg" alt="Tickspot-timer in Effective Strategy To Estimate Time For Your Design Projects" width="344" height="315" /></a></p><p>Of course many of you will do this by default as it allows you to:</p><ul><li>Know how long you have to complete each phase</li><li>View how long you have for each task and sub-task</li><li>Reporting on how long everything actually took</li></ul><p>But the real value of keeping a consistent set of high-level phases, from estimate through to time tracking, is that after a few projects you can begin toanalyse the data and start to identify averages and trends that you can use to refine your next web project estimate.</p><h4>Analyse Estimated vs. Actual Time</h4><p><strong>This is where the real magic happens!</strong> By breaking down and tracking your time for multiple projects into consistent phases and tasks, you will have valid comparable data to analyse, for example, after five projects, once you average out the numbers, you may well discover the following:</p><ul><li>Research and planning took around <strong>5%</strong> of the total project time to complete</li><li>Solution design: <strong>5%</strong></li><li>Design: <strong>25%</strong></li><li>Front-end development: <strong>15%</strong></li><li>Back-end development: <strong>30%</strong></li><li>Content entry: <strong>8%</strong></li><li>Testing: <strong>10%</strong></li><li>Go-live: <strong>2%</strong></li></ul><p>The more projects completed that use a consistent estimating and time tracking structure, the more real your averages will become.</p><p class="showcase"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/images/estimation-project-management/estimated-vs-actual-analysis.jpg" alt="Estimated-vs-actual-analysis in Effective Strategy To Estimate Time For Your Design Projects" width="478" height="310" /></p><p>With this valuable information you can then set about <strong>increasing the accuracy of your next estimate</strong> by being able to, assuming you can get a budget range from the client:</p><ul><li>Immediately allocate the estimated hours you need for each phase</li><li>Determine the best solution you can offer the client for their budget</li></ul><p>It even allows you to accommodate the client that &#8216;needs an estimate tomorrow&#8217; when you don&#8217;t have time to break it down in detail.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Estimating time for a web project accurately is something many attempt everyday but few manage to succeed at. There is no one formula that will satisfy every situation and the chances of estimating what a project will cost exactly are almost zero.</p><p>But <strong>it is possible to drastically increase the accuracy of your web project estimates</strong> by:</p><ol><li>Identifying the reasons why underestimating is so common</li><li>Understanding why it is so important</li><li>Resisting the temptation to not get granular</li><li>Creating a consistent, methodical and re-usable estimating process</li><li>Analysing the estimated versus actual data from multiple projects to identify trends</li></ol><p><em>&#8220;<strong>The Devil is in the detail</strong>: When people say that the devil is in the detail, they mean that small things in plans and schemes that are often overlooked can cause serious problems later on.&#8221;</em></p><h3>Further Resources</h3><p>Here are further articles and related resources that may help you to increase the accuracy of your web project estimates:</p><ul><li><a href="http://astuteo.com/estimator">Web Development Project Estimator</a><br /> A neat little online tool that allows designers and developers to quickly create cost estimates for web projects.</li><li><a href="http://konigi.com/tools/schedule-and-cost-summary-calculator">Schedule and Cost Summary</a><br /> This Cost Estimate and Scheduling spreadsheet provides a lightweight method for learning to estimate time to complete a web design project, and calculating cost for completion.</li><li><a href="http://tickspot.com">Tick</a><br /> Simple to use time tracking tool that makes it easy to keep track of project budgets.</li><li><a href="http://www.webdevbiz.com/article.cfm?VarArtID=5">How to Estimate a Web Site Project </a><br /> Patty Ayers discusses a five-step process for estimating web projects.</li><li><a href="http://woork.blogspot.com/2009/02/simple-process-to-estimate-time-and.html">Simple process to estimate times and costs in a web project</a><br /> Antonio Lupetti describes his process for creating web project cost estimates.</li><li><a href="http://www.myintervals.com/blog/2008/09/05/how-to-accurately-estimate-a-web-design-project">How to Accurately Estimate a Web Design Project</a><br /> John Reeve talks about catering for the usual missing elements in estimates; project management, contingency time and margin for error.</li><li><a href="http://www.effectivedevelopment.net/2009/06/estimating-resource-time-web-development-projects">Estimating Resource Time for Web Development Projects</a><br /> Bill Breen explains one way to approach estimating time for web projects, and how the size of the project should influence you estimate ranges.</li><li><a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2009/04/14/how-to-estimate-time-for-a-project">How To Estimate Time For A Project</a><br /> A Sitepoint article by Alyssa Gregory.</li></ul><h3>Related posts</h3><p>You may be interested in the following related posts:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/11/13/15-useful-project-management-tools/">15 Useful Project Management Tools</a></li><li><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/02/10/10-harsh-truths-about-corporate-websites/">10 Harsh Truths About Corporate Websites</a></li></ul><a href="http://twitter.com/share?count=horizontal&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smashingmagazine.com%2F2009%2F06%2F11%2Feffective-strategy-to-estimate-time-for-your-design-projects%2F&amp;via=smashingmag&amp;text=Effective%20Strategy%20To%20Estimate%20Time%20For%20Your%20Design%20Projects" class="twitter-share-button" target="_blank">Tweet</a><br/> <iframe class="facebooklike" src="http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smashingmagazine.com%2F2009%2F06%2F11%2Feffective-strategy-to-estimate-time-for-your-design-projects%2F&amp;layout=standard&amp;show_faces=false&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;colorscheme=light&amp;height=35" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></div><div class="bio clearfix"><div class="gravatar"> <img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3abd4d4780f8bddabb22498f796b71b0?s=78&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D78&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-78 photo' height='78' width='78' /></div><div class="about"> <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/sam-barnes/" title="Posts by Sam Barnes"  class="post-author">Sam Barnes</a><p>Sam Barnes is a Technology Analyst at <a href="http://www.volume.co.uk">Volume</a>.

What we do has value. If we as a &#8220;community&#8221; of designers and developers want to be compensated appropriately then having discussions about the best ways to estimate time and plan projects means we can make better decisions about what we should ask of our clients in return for our services.</p><div class="commentmeta"><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='/2009/06/11/effective-strategy-to-estimate-time-for-your-design-projects/?replytocom=357312#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm("comment-357312", "357312", "respond", "7742")'>Reply</a></div></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1 clearfix "> <span class="commentnumber">17</span><div class="comment" id="comment-357344"><div class="commentrating clearfix"><div class="rateresult">0</div> <a class="ratebtn down_active" id="btn-357344-down" style="opacity:0.3;" title="Vote down!

Many clients don&#8217;t know much about web design and marketing, which makes it difficult for them to say what exactly they need.<br /> When I interview a client, I always have a checklist with me to make sure I record as many details as possible.

Especially when estimating time for the graphic design phase, as I can spend days in Photoshop playing around and tweaking little things here and there.  I feel like many clients don&#8217;t understand, or aren&#8217;t sympathetic to how long the design process can take.  Also, how do you take into account the number of revisions the client will ask for?  I&#8217;ve had some clients approve the first comp I sent them, and others who have sent it back 10 times just to change the shade of blue of a tab.</p><div class="commentmeta"><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='/2009/06/11/effective-strategy-to-estimate-time-for-your-design-projects/?replytocom=357357#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm("comment-357357", "357357", "respond", "7742")'>Reply</a></div></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 clearfix "> <span class="commentnumber">20</span><div class="comment" id="comment-357358"><div class="commentrating clearfix"><div class="rateresult">0</div> <a class="ratebtn down_active" id="btn-357358-down" style="opacity:0.3;" title="Vote down!

I conducted surveys with some of the CMS users, reviewed other similar products to get ideas for best feature set, and had many rounds of review with the project stakeholders. Then I spent several days reviewing the requirements with the tech lead and planning out phases for the project. It was only then that we were asked to make an estimate for the design, development, test &amp; implementation of the project.</p><p>This is a unique situation I&#8217;m sure (is anyone else out there drooling yet?) where it&#8217;s a preexisting client who really trusts the team and understands the importance of spending all that time in discovery and planning. I was actually getting pressure internally from the higher ups to speed up the discovery/planning so that the rest of the team could get started on new billable work. Isn&#8217;t that how it always is&#8230; (sigh). Not sure how the estimate was vs actual because I wasn&#8217;t at the company long enough to see the entire project through.</p><p>Anyway, another situation we sometimes find ourselves in is where we&#8217;ve pitched a project and won the work on a set price before we (or the client) has really had time to figure out what the project will be. In those situation it&#8217;s critical put the same amount of effort/planning into discovery to ensure that nothing is missed, scope is clearly defined and there are no &#8216;surprises&#8217; later on. If the client says they want something that will tip the budget over the edge, then it&#8217;s time to either cut back on other features or go into change control mode and revise the budget.</p><p>As for what you mentioned about using time tracking software to review actual vs estimate, I would love that feature in the time tracker that my company uses, but we can only record actual vs estimate for the entire project and not on specific tasks. I&#8217;d be curious to hear what time tracking applications have this feature. I use LiquidPlanner for project management, and it allows the task owner to update the task with the actual time spent (LiquidPlanner also has a robust time tracking system so this can all be done automatically). So, this way you wont need to go to a separate system to run reports on actual vs estimate, it&#8217;s all in the same place.</p><div class="commentmeta"><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='/2009/06/11/effective-strategy-to-estimate-time-for-your-design-projects/?replytocom=357406#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm("comment-357406", "357406", "respond", "7742")'>Reply</a></div></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 clearfix "> <span class="commentnumber">24</span><div class="comment" id="comment-357410"><div class="commentrating clearfix"><div class="rateresult">0</div> <a class="ratebtn down_active" id="btn-357410-down" style="opacity:0.3;" title="Vote down!

The point this most happens is when the client first sees the mockup. It is so important to wireframe before you start the hard coding because the client can see it as it moves towards the coding. I block wireframe then visual wireframe and then build. Because they have already agreed to the wireframes twice you are in a much stronger position to push back or renegotiate. You can also quickly spot or change anything minor. The worst thing you can do is hand code from the get-go in the hope they like it, they rarely do!</p><div class="commentmeta"><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='/2009/06/11/effective-strategy-to-estimate-time-for-your-design-projects/?replytocom=357475#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm("comment-357475", "357475", "respond", "7742")'>Reply</a></div></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1 clearfix "> <span class="commentnumber">31</span><div class="comment" id="comment-357492"><div class="commentrating clearfix"><div class="rateresult">0</div> <a class="ratebtn down_active" id="btn-357492-down" style="opacity:0.3;" title="Vote down!

Your team continuously delivers top-notch content which I follow religiously.</p><p>I second the wireframe suggestion from Simon Day. Nothing better than something to point at and get a signoff.</p><p>Even before the estimate phase, it is vitally important to assess the fit between your agency (or you as independent) and the client. A business relationship is a human interaction. There must be chemistry and understanding for there to be success. It is complicated by money, schedules, and expectations. We have learned from experience, that if it does not feel right from the start, no amount of rationalization will change that. Trust me on this one.</p><p>Our criteria for determining fit:</p><p>1. Client resources. Do they have staff/mgt with time to devote to the project. At minimum you need them to show up for review and approval of your work. Even better if they can do some of the work, like planning. The less resources on the client side, the more work you will have to do managing the project, and the longer it will take to get done. Remember, you get blamed when the project is late.</p><p>2. Client&#8217;s experience buying creative and/or programming services. If they are inexperienced, be cautious. If they are aware of their ignorance and willing to learn, maybe.</p><p>3. Client&#8217;s expectations. Related to #2. Does the client know if what they want is feasible? Have they done projects like this before?</p><p>4. Budget. Clients either have an idea of budget or they don&#8217;t. If they have a budget in mind, then the question is if the expectations in #3 will fit into that budget. If not, then cut scope. The cut items go into future phases that are paid separately. Do not cut price. Never, ever cut price. Once you set that precedent they will always ask for price concessions. If you don&#8217;t value your own time, why should your client.</p><p>If they do not have an idea of budget and want their vendor to tell them the cost to do it right, follow Smashing&#8217;s advice of a spec phase. We use this tactic. It is a win-win situation, and a fair compromise. If the client declines, we over-estimate to cover ourselves. This either puts us out of the running (and if so, to the best since it is not a good fit), or we have enough cushion to cover the unknowns and ensure profit.</p><p>5. Do not accept work that is not portfolio-worthy. This is an ironclad rule &#8211; do not break it. While it is tempting to take work for the paycheck, don&#8217;t. Your portfolio is an investment. You will not get better clients if you can&#8217;t show past work. Our business improved once we had the courage to say no. Honestly and professionally, of course. Ways to say no include, &#8220;This is not a good fit for our firm,&#8221; &#8220;Your needs would be better served by another firm,&#8221; or simply &#8220;We respectfully decline.&#8221; You will be surprised how much respect this buys your business. It means you have standards.</p><p>Regarding the situation where the estimate is needed tomorrow. In this case we will do an executive overview: a one page summary with a ballpark estimate. We stipulate that this number is preliminary, but a good faith estimate based on limited information, and subject to refinement as the project is developed. If the number is in an acceptable range (get client signature on that), we will proceed with a detailed estimate and statement of work. If not, then you answered the budget question early, and you can move on to other jobs.</p><p>Gaird, Interactive Director.</p><div class="commentmeta"><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='/2009/06/11/effective-strategy-to-estimate-time-for-your-design-projects/?replytocom=357683#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm("comment-357683", "357683", "respond", "7742")'>Reply</a></div></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 clearfix "> <span class="commentnumber">50</span><div class="comment" id="comment-357694"><div class="commentrating clearfix"><div class="rateresult">0</div> <a class="ratebtn down_active" id="btn-357694-down" style="opacity:0.3;" title="Vote down!

An important point of it really is that a very detailed estimate will make the client confident that you are a good pick for the job. Estimates should even raise questions and issues (about technologies for example) that the client may not have think about in his brief. It sure takes time but it is worth it 75% of the time. Of course once in a while the client run out with your 30-50 pages detailed functionnalities and estimates and go ask someone else to do it cheaper&#8230; damm ! but oh well.</p><div class="commentmeta"><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='/2009/06/11/effective-strategy-to-estimate-time-for-your-design-projects/?replytocom=357941#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm("comment-357941", "357941", "respond", "7742")'>Reply</a></div></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 clearfix "> <span class="commentnumber">62</span><div class="comment" id="comment-357967"><div class="commentrating clearfix"><div class="rateresult">0</div> <a class="ratebtn down_active" id="btn-357967-down" style="opacity:0.3;" title="Vote down!

Our agency uses Clients and Profits for managing the time and cost of  jobs. It does a good job of showing actual vs. estimated costs side by side for each Task. I find it limiting in how the estimates are entered and summarized for sending to the client &#8212; it feels more appropriate for print jobs, and not nearly as specific as needed for all the granular stuff of web project specification. I start out with an excel spreadsheet with as much detail as I can visualize given the project brief, inserting each task that would be part of the project, specifying how it would be done. But when the job goes into the estimating sheet in Clients and Profits, we only see the main breakdowns, like Planning, Project Management, Design, Development, Photography, Video Editing, Copy Writing, etc., along with the section totals for each of these areas. The exact specifications are thought of as &#8220;overwhelm&#8221; when giving the client the project estimate, but in my mind, they need to know *exactly* what the estimate is built on. When we don&#8217;t get specific, it&#8217;s hard to manage project creep, as the client expects any function that comes up to be included. Often we have to &#8220;option&#8221; out various upgraded functions or recommendations we have &#8211; another thing that is not easy to handle in the Clients and Profits estimating interface. I like to show two sets of costs &#8211; kind of &#8220;base&#8221; and &#8220;upgraded&#8221; &#8211; for some sections/functions, since at estimating, we don&#8217;t know yet which way the client may wish to go. Finally, when we get down to what the desired scope of the project is, and what the realistic budget is, we often move some functions to &#8220;Phase 2&#8243;, to be added in when next year&#8217;s budget allows. This helps plan them into the overall architecture/design up front.</p><p>For complex web projects, we attempted to make it part of our process to do the Research/Discovery &amp; Specifications stage first, as a paid project. We could estimate time for this, as well as guarantee the outcome: a fully-specified project with accurate costs, from which to build out, no matter which agency was selected for the design/development job. We have rarely been able to actually go down this path, as ideal as it would be, as the complete project budget often needs to be known up front before the client can approve going forward at all.</p><div class="commentmeta"><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='/2009/06/11/effective-strategy-to-estimate-time-for-your-design-projects/?replytocom=358059#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm("comment-358059", "358059", "respond", "7742")'>Reply</a></div></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 clearfix "> <span class="commentnumber">66</span><div class="comment" id="comment-358067"><div class="commentrating clearfix"><div class="rateresult">0</div> <a class="ratebtn down_active" id="btn-358067-down" style="opacity:0.3;" title="Vote down!

I know that i depends of a lot of things, but an article about that would be relly helpful, becouse i&#8217;m doing the design of a children magazine, really small one, like 10-12 pages. I&#8217;ve alredy work with this client, i did some credits for his cartoon and he like it a lot. He gave me a great opportunity of design the credits and now, the magazine even when i&#8217;m still learning graphic design. For the magazine, he&#8217;s paying me $45, i don&#8217;t know if that is too much or too little. If someone can help me with that i would be awesome.<br /> cheers!<br /> ps. sorry for the bad english</p><div class="commentmeta"><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='/2009/06/11/effective-strategy-to-estimate-time-for-your-design-projects/?replytocom=358067#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm("comment-358067", "358067", "respond", "7742")'>Reply</a></div></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1 clearfix "> <span class="commentnumber">67</span><div class="comment" id="comment-358106"><div class="commentrating clearfix"><div class="rateresult">0</div> <a class="ratebtn down_active" id="btn-358106-down" style="opacity:0.3;" title="Vote down!

Both cars will get you from point A to point B. The sales person needs more information before they can know what the real scope of your needs are.</p><p>I&#8217;m suspicious of a prospect who calls and asks for a proposal or price &#8220;tomorrow.&#8221;  Do they already have a proposal from a competitor and someone up the management chain has said &#8220;I like that proposal; let&#8217;s go when that one, but get two more proposals before we pick them; the board will want to know we did &#8216;due diligence&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p>I would ask the prospect, &#8220;Do you presently have proposals on this project?&#8221; [If yes, ask] &#8220;How long ago did you request them?&#8221; and &#8220;Have you worked with this company in the past?&#8221; and &#8220;Were you satisfied with what they did for you then?&#8221; [If yes, ask] &#8220;Why wouldn&#8217;t you choose them for this project?&#8221;</p><p>If you&#8217;ve worked with this client (not a new prospect) in the past, you will be able to reflect on things that might affect the &#8216;fudge-factor&#8217; you&#8217;ll need to build in to the proposal. Things like how much nit-picking on the design and/or copy there will be and how many levels of approval they will need to go through before the proposal and the ultimate project submissions are OK&#8217;d. And how strict deadlines really are with the client, etc. (There&#8217;s never time enough to do it now, but always time to do it over.)</p><p>Another comeback question when they ask for your next-day price/proposal is &#8220;When do you actually need the work you are proposing?&#8221;</p><p>This helps determine if they need your proposal for a project that they have procrastinated on for weeks or months or if they are collecting budget prices for a project next quarter or next fiscal year and the budget deadline is day after tomorrow.</p><p>It&#8217;s tempting to low-ball prices when you have a &#8216;hot prospect&#8217; that needs the work &#8216;tomorrow.&#8217; But can you deliver? Can you push off current work to take on this &#8216;urgent&#8217; project in hopes of winning over a new client.</p><p>If you ARE the &#8216;winner&#8217;, will they expect all your work will be done this cheaply and this fast?</p><p>Might they think you must not have much business right now since you can turn this project quickly and Is THAT the kind of person/agency with which they should be working?</p><p>Hope I didn&#8217;t stray too far from the original content of a very good article.</p><p>Sign me: An entrepreneur and free-lancer with 35+ years of experience.</p><div class="commentmeta"><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='/2009/06/11/effective-strategy-to-estimate-time-for-your-design-projects/?replytocom=358220#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm("comment-358220", "358220", "respond", "7742")'>Reply</a></div></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 clearfix "> <span class="commentnumber">70</span><div class="comment" id="comment-358223"><div class="commentrating clearfix"><div class="rateresult">0</div> <a class="ratebtn down_active" id="btn-358223-down" style="opacity:0.3;" title="Vote down!

We often get asked to scope out an entire project for e-commerce sites, and we found a good solution in case the client shops it elsewhere.<br /> We do all of the research and deliver a detailed proposal, which usually takes us around 2 weeks (about 80 hours) and charge the time. If the client chooses to go with us, we prorate the amount towards the entire project. If not, they pay the invoiced amount.<br /> So far this seemed to have been working very well.</p><div class="commentmeta"><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='/2009/06/11/effective-strategy-to-estimate-time-for-your-design-projects/?replytocom=358297#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm("comment-358297", "358297", "respond", "7742")'>Reply</a></div></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1 clearfix "> <span class="commentnumber">73</span><div class="comment" id="comment-358385"><div class="commentrating clearfix"><div class="rateresult">0</div> <a class="ratebtn down_active" id="btn-358385-down" style="opacity:0.3;" title="Vote down!

There is a lot I learned from this. Also, this article gives me assurance that I am going things the right way.</p><p>A point I would add to it is:<br /> Get your documents ready. Every freelancer needs templates for Estimates, Project Timeline, an NDA and a Design Sign-Off Document. I have had to build those templates when I started off and they have evolved over time.</p><p>Also, always ask the client for a sitemap. With a sitemap, you&#8217;ll know how many templates need to be designed and how long each may take. If the client is unable to provide a sitemap, arrange a meeting with the director/execs to determine what exactly they&#8217;re trying to achieve with the new site.</p><p>Thank you for this fabulous article.</p><p>Saddam Azad<br /> Web Designer and Front-end Web Developer<br /> London, UK<br /> Azadcreative.com</p><div class="commentmeta"><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='/2009/06/11/effective-strategy-to-estimate-time-for-your-design-projects/?replytocom=359861#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm("comment-359861", "359861", "respond", "7742")'>Reply</a></div></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1 clearfix "> <span class="commentnumber">83</span><div class="comment" id="comment-360899"><div class="commentrating clearfix"><div class="rateresult">0</div> <a class="ratebtn down_active" id="btn-360899-down" style="opacity:0.3;" title="Vote down!
