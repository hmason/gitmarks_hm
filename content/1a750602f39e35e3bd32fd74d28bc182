      (The Independent, 23 January, 2005)<br>
      <font size="1">The idea of outdoor schools, primarily for health reasons, 
      derived from the sanatoria that sprang up in Europe in the latter part of 
      the 19th century.&nbsp; In the sanatoria, fresh air and sunshine as much 
        as medicine were used to treat tuberculosis (TB), with mixed success.&nbsp; This idea was 
      extended in Britain during the first half of the 20th century, with the focus on 
        improving the health of children who were seen as sickly and susceptible to TB.&nbsp; 
        The schools were 
      truly open-air (no walls) with purposeful, harsh (but supposedly healthy) 
      environmental conditions, especially during winter, intentional.&nbsp; By the 1940's 
      there were 155 open-air schools and they aimed to improve both health and  academics.&nbsp; These open-air schools shared much 
        with the philosophy with 
      Baden-Powell's scouting movement and Outward Bound.</font>

    <h2><a name="Studying"></a>Studying Experiential Learning</h2>
    <p>Several authors (e.g., Kraft, 1991; Richards, 1977) have pointed out that 
    experiential learning dates back beyond recorded history and remains 
    pervasive in current society, whether formalized by educational institutions 
    or occurring informally in day-to-day life. In this sense, experiential 
    learning is not an alternative approach, but the most traditional and 
    fundamental method of human learning. Ironically, the current perception of 
    experiential education as ‘different’ is probably less due to new 
    developments in experiential learning than it is to the normalization of 
    didactic teaching as the mainstream educational methodology. </p>
    <p>For these reasons, those seeking a deeper understanding of experiential 
    learning should consider the philosophies of not only contemporary figures 
    such as <a href="/KurtHahn.html">Kurt Hahn</a> (who was inspired by and utilized Plato’s “The Republic” 
    in designing Outward Bound programs), Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle, 
    and so on, but also include study of those who have previously described the 
    process of experiential learning long before many current forms of 
    experiential education began. Main figures in this sense are John Dewey and 
    Paulo Freire, but also consider how the work of William James, Maria 
    Montessori, Rudolf Steiner and Francis Boal apply to our current educational 
    situations. </p>
    <p>Since the 1950's there has been a growing focus in writings and research 
    specifically on experiential learning. Major sources for such material 
    related to experiential learning in the outdoors are journals, conferences, 
    books (e.g., edited texts that focus on current thinking in experiential 
    learning such as Boud, et al., 1993; Weil &amp; McGill, 1989), and websites.</p></td>
