<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

Your friends and colleagues are talking about something called "Bayes'
Theorem" or "Bayes' Rule", or something called Bayesian
reasoning.&nbsp;
They sound really enthusiastic about it, too, so you google and find a
webpage about Bayes' Theorem and...<br> 
<br> 
It's this equation.&nbsp; That's all.&nbsp; Just one equation.&nbsp;
The page you found gives a definition of it, but it doesn't say what it
is, or why it's useful, or why your friends would be interested in
it.&nbsp; It looks like this random statistics thing.<br> 
<br> 
So you came here.&nbsp; Maybe you don't understand what the equation
says.&nbsp; Maybe you understand it in theory, but every time you try
to
apply it in practice you get mixed up trying to remember the difference
between <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(a|x)</span> and <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(x|a)</span>, and whether <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(a)*p(x|a)</span> belongs in the
numerator or the denominator.&nbsp; Maybe you see the theorem, and you
understand the theorem, and you can use the theorem, but you can't
understand why your friends and/or research colleagues seem to think
it's the secret of the universe.&nbsp; Maybe your friends are all
wearing Bayes' Theorem T-shirts, and you're feeling left out.&nbsp;
Maybe you're a girl looking for a boyfriend, but the boy you're
interested in refuses to date anyone who "isn't Bayesian".&nbsp; What
matters is that Bayes is cool, and if you don't know Bayes, you aren't
cool.<br> 
<br> 
Why does a mathematical concept generate this strange enthusiasm in its
students?&nbsp; What is the so-called Bayesian Revolution now sweeping
through the sciences, which claims to subsume even the experimental
method itself as a special case?&nbsp; What is the secret that the
adherents of Bayes know?&nbsp; What is the light that they have seen?<br> 
<br> 
Soon you will know.&nbsp; Soon you will be one of us.<br> 
<br> 
While there are a few existing online explanations of Bayes' Theorem,
my experience with trying to introduce people to Bayesian reasoning is
that the existing online explanations are too abstract.&nbsp; Bayesian
reasoning is very<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">counterintuitive.</span>&nbsp; People do
not employ Bayesian reasoning intuitively, find it very difficult to
learn Bayesian reasoning when tutored, and rapidly forget Bayesian
methods once the tutoring is over.&nbsp; This holds equally true for
novice students and highly trained professionals in a field.&nbsp;
Bayesian reasoning is apparently one of those things which, like
quantum
mechanics or the Wason Selection Test, is inherently difficult for
humans to grasp with our built-in mental faculties.<br> 
<br> 
Or so they claim.&nbsp; Here you will find an attempt to offer an <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">intuitive</span> explanation of Bayesian
reasoning - an excruciatingly gentle introduction that invokes all the
human ways of grasping numbers, from natural frequencies to spatial
visualization.&nbsp; The intent is to convey, not abstract rules for
manipulating numbers, but what the numbers mean, and why the rules are
what they are (and cannot possibly be anything else).&nbsp; When you
are
finished reading this page, you will see Bayesian problems in your
dreams.<br> 
<br> 
And let's begin.<br> 
<br> 
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br> 
Here's a story problem about a situation that doctors often encounter:<br> 
<br> 
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">1% of women at age forty who
participate in routine screening have breast cancer.&nbsp; 80% of women
with breast cancer will get positive mammographies.&nbsp; 9.6% of women
without breast cancer will also get positive mammographies.&nbsp; A
woman in this age group had a positive mammography in a routine
screening.&nbsp; What is the probability that she actually has breast
cancer?<br> 
</div> 
<br> 
What do you think the answer is?&nbsp; If you haven't encountered this
kind of problem before, please take a moment to come up with your own
answer before continuing.<br> 
<br> 
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br> 
Next, suppose I told you that most doctors get the same wrong answer on
this problem - usually, only around 15% of doctors get it right.&nbsp;
("Really?&nbsp; 15%?&nbsp; Is that a real number, or an urban legend
based on an Internet poll?"&nbsp; It's a real number.&nbsp; See
Casscells, Schoenberger, and Grayboys 1978; Eddy 1982; Gigerenzer and
Hoffrage 1995; and many other studies.&nbsp; It's a surprising result
which is easy to replicate, so it's been extensively replicated.)<br> 
<br> 
Do you want to think about your answer again?&nbsp; Here's a Javascript
calculator if you need one.&nbsp; This calculator has the usual
precedence rules; multiplication before addition and so on.&nbsp; If
you're not sure, I suggest using parentheses.<br> 
<br> 
<form> Calculator: <input type="text" name="expression"
 value="(1 + 2) * 3 + 4" onchange="compute(this.form)"
 onkeyup="compute(this.form)" size="50"> Result: <input type="text"
 name="result" size="5" value=""> <input type="button"
 name="computeButton" value="Compute!" onclick="compute(this.form)"> </form> 
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br> 
On the story problem above, most doctors estimate the probability to be
between 70% and 80%, which is wildly incorrect.<br> 
<br> 
Here's an alternate version of the problem on which doctors fare
somewhat better:<br> 
<br> 
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">10 out of 1000 women at age forty who
participate in routine screening have breast cancer.&nbsp; 800 out of
1000 women with breast cancer will get positive mammographies.&nbsp; 96
out of 1000 women without breast cancer will also get positive
mammographies.&nbsp; If 1000 women in this age group undergo a routine
screening, about what fraction of women with positive mammographies
will
actually have breast cancer?<br> 
</div> 
<br> 
<form> Calculator: <input type="text" name="expression"
 value="(1 + 2) * 3 + 4" onchange="compute(this.form)"
 onkeyup="compute(this.form)" size="50"> Result: <input name="result"
 size="5" value=""> <input type="button" name="computeButton"
 value="Compute!" onclick="compute(this.form)"> </form> 
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br> 
And finally, here's the problem on which doctors fare best of all, with
46% - nearly half - arriving at the correct answer:<br> 
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br> 
100 out of 10,000 women at age forty who participate in routine
screening have breast cancer.&nbsp; 80 of every 100 women with breast
cancer will get a positive mammography.&nbsp; 950 out of&nbsp; 9,900
women without breast cancer will also get a positive mammography.&nbsp;
If 10,000 women in this age group undergo a routine screening, about
what fraction of women with positive mammographies will actually have
breast cancer?<br> 
</div> 
<br> 
<form> Calculator: <input type="text" name="expression"
 value="(1 + 2) * 3 + 4" onchange="compute(this.form)"
 onkeyup="compute(this.form)" size="50"> Result: <input name="result"
 size="5"> <input type="button" name="computeButton" value="Compute!"
 onclick="compute(this.form)"> </form> 
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br> 
The correct answer is 7.8%, obtained as follows:&nbsp; Out of 10,000
women, 100 have breast cancer; 80 of those 100 have positive
mammographies.&nbsp; From the same 10,000 women, 9,900 will not have
breast cancer and of those 9,900 women, 950 will also get positive
mammographies.&nbsp; This makes the total number of women with positive
mammographies 950+80 or 1,030.&nbsp; Of those 1,030 women with positive
mammographies, 80 will have cancer.&nbsp; Expressed as a proportion,
this is 80/1,030 or 0.07767 or 7.8%.<br> 
<br> 
To put it another way, before the mammography screening, the 10,000
women can be divided into two groups:<br> 
<ul> 
  <li>Group 1:&nbsp; 100 women <span style="font-style: italic;">with </span>breast
cancer.</li> 
  <li>Group 2:&nbsp; 9,900 women <span style="font-style: italic;">without </span>breast
cancer.<br> 
  </li> 
</ul> 
Summing these two groups gives a total of 10,000 patients, confirming
that none have been lost in the math.&nbsp; After the mammography, the
women can be divided into four groups:<br> 
<ul> 
  <li>Group A:&nbsp; 80 women <span style="font-style: italic;">with </span>breast
cancer, and a <span style="font-style: italic;">positive </span>mammography.<br> 
  </li> 
  <li>Group B:&nbsp; 20 women <span style="font-style: italic;">with </span>breast
cancer, and a <span style="font-style: italic;">negative </span>mammography.<br> 
  </li> 
  <li>Group C:&nbsp; 950 women <span style="font-style: italic;">without</span>&nbsp;
breast cancer, and a <span style="font-style: italic;">positive </span>mammography.<br> 
  </li> 
  <li>Group D:&nbsp; 8,950 women <span style="font-style: italic;">without</span> 
breast cancer, and a <span style="font-style: italic;">negative</span> 
mammography.<br> 
  </li> 
</ul> 
<form> Calculator: <input name="expression"
 value="80 + 20 + 950 + 8950" onchange="compute(this.form)"
 onkeyup="compute(this.form)" size="50"> 
Result: <input name="result" size="5"> <input type="button"
 name="computeButton" value="Compute!" onclick="compute(this.form)"> </form> 
As you can check, the sum of all four groups is still 10,000.&nbsp; The
sum of groups A and B, the groups with breast cancer, corresponds to
group 1; and the sum of groups C and D, the groups without breast
cancer, corresponds to group 2; so administering a mammography does not
actually <span style="font-style: italic;">change</span> the number of
women with breast cancer.&nbsp; The proportion of the cancer patients
(A
+ B) within the complete set of patients (A + B + C + D) is the same as
the 1% prior chance that a woman has cancer: (80 + 20) / (80 + 20 + 950
+ 8950) = 100 / 10000 = 1%.<br> 
<br> 
The proportion of cancer patients with positive results, within the
group of <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> patients with
positive results, is the proportion of (A) within (A + C):&nbsp;&nbsp;
80 / (80 + 950) = 80 / 1030 = 7.8%.&nbsp; If you administer a
mammography to 10,000 patients, then out of the 1030 with positive
mammographies, 80 of those positive-mammography patients will have
cancer.&nbsp; This is the correct answer, the answer a doctor should
give a positive-mammography patient if she asks about the chance she
has
breast cancer; if thirteen patients ask this question, roughly 1 out of
those 13 will have cancer.<br> 
<br> 
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br> 
The most common mistake is to ignore the original fraction of women
with breast cancer, and the fraction of women without breast cancer who
receive false positives, and focus only on the fraction of women with
breast cancer who get positive results.&nbsp; For example, the vast
majority of doctors in these studies seem to have thought that if
around
80% of women with breast cancer have positive mammographies, then the
probability of a women with a positive mammography having breast cancer
must be around 80%.<br> 
<br> 
Figuring out the final answer always requires <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">all three</span> pieces of information -
the percentage of women with breast cancer, the percentage of women
without breast cancer who receive false positives, and the percentage
of
women with breast cancer who receive (correct) positives.<br> 
<br> 
To see that the final answer always depends on the original fraction of
women with breast cancer, consider an alternate universe in which only
one woman out of a million has breast cancer.&nbsp; Even if mammography
in this world&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>detects
breast cancer in 8 out of 10 cases, while returning a false positive on
a woman without breast cancer in only 1 out of 10 cases, there will
still be a hundred thousand false positives for every real case of
cancer detected.&nbsp; The original probability that a woman has cancer
is so extremely low that, although a positive result on the mammography
does <span style="font-style: italic;">increase</span> the estimated
probability, the probability isn't increased to certainty or even "a
noticeable chance"; the probability goes from 1:1,000,000 to 1:100,000.<br> 
<br> 
Similarly, in an alternate universe where only one out of a million
women does <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> have breast
cancer, a positive result on the patient's mammography obviously
doesn't
mean that she has an 80% chance of having breast cancer!&nbsp; If this
were the case her estimated probability of having cancer would have
been
revised drastically <span style="font-style: italic;">downward</span> 
after she got a <span style="font-style: italic;">positive</span> 
result
on her mammography - an 80% chance of having cancer is a lot less than
99.9999%!&nbsp; If you administer mammographies to ten million women in
this world, around eight million women with breast cancer will get
correct positive results, while one woman without breast cancer will
get
false positive results.&nbsp; Thus, if you got a positive mammography
in
this alternate universe, your chance of having cancer would go from
99.9999% up to 99.999987%.&nbsp; That is, your chance of being healthy
would go from 1:1,000,000 down to 1:8,000,000.<br> 
<br> 
These two extreme examples help demonstrate that the mammography result
doesn't <span style="font-style: italic;">replace</span> your old
information about the patient's chance of having cancer; the
mammography <span style="font-style: italic;">slides</span> the
estimated probability in
the direction of the result.&nbsp; A positive result slides the
original
probability upward; a negative result slides the probability
downward.&nbsp; For example, in the original problem where 1% of the
women have cancer, 80% of women with cancer get positive mammographies,
and 9.6% of women without cancer get positive mammographies, a positive
result on the mammography <span style="font-style: italic;">slides </span>the
1% chance upward to 7.8%.<br> 
<br> 
Most people encountering problems of this type for the first time carry
out the mental operation of <span style="font-style: italic;">replacing</span> 
the original 1% probability with the 80% probability that a woman with
cancer gets a positive mammography.&nbsp; It may seem like a good idea,
but it just doesn't work.&nbsp; "The probability that a woman with a
positive mammography has breast cancer" is not at all the same thing as
"the probability that a woman with breast cancer has a positive
mammography"; they are as unlike as apples and cheese.&nbsp; Finding
the
final answer, "the probability that a woman with a positive mammography
has breast cancer", uses all three pieces of problem information - "the
prior probability that a woman has breast cancer", "the probability
that
a woman with breast cancer gets a positive mammography", and "the
probability that a woman without breast cancer gets a positive
mammography".<br>

To see that the final answer always depends on the chance that a woman <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">without</span> breast cancer gets a
positive mammography, consider an alternate test, mammography+.&nbsp;
Like the original test, mammography+ returns positive for 80% of women
with breast cancer.&nbsp; However, mammography+ returns a positive
result for only one out of a million women without breast cancer -
mammography+ has the same rate of false negatives, but a vastly lower
rate of false positives.&nbsp; Suppose a patient receives a positive
mammography+.&nbsp; What is the chance that this patient has breast
cancer?&nbsp; Under the new test, it is a virtual certainty - 99.988%,
i.e., a 1 in 8082 chance of being healthy.<br> 
<br> 
<form> Calculator: <input name="expression"
 value="80 / [80 + (9900 * 0.000001)]" onchange="compute(this.form)"
 onkeyup="compute(this.form)" size="50"> Result: <input name="result"
 size="5"> <input type="button" name="computeButton" value="Compute!"
 onclick="compute(this.form)"><br> 
</form> 
Remember, at this point, that neither mammography nor mammography+
actually <span style="font-style: italic;">change</span> the number of
women who have breast cancer.&nbsp; It may seem like "There is a
virtual
certainty you have breast cancer" is a terrible thing to say, causing
much distress and despair; that the more hopeful verdict of the
previous
mammography test - a 7.8% chance of having breast cancer - was much to
be preferred.&nbsp; This comes under the heading of "Don't shoot the
messenger".&nbsp; The number of women who really do have cancer stays
exactly the same between the two cases.&nbsp; Only the accuracy with
which we <span style="font-style: italic;">detect </span>cancer
changes.&nbsp; Under the previous mammography test, 80 women with
cancer
(who <span style="font-style: italic;">already</span> had cancer,
before
the mammography) are first told that they have a 7.8% chance of having
cancer, creating X amount of uncertainty and fear, after which more
detailed tests will inform them that they definitely do have breast
cancer.&nbsp; The old mammography test also involves informing 950
women <span style="font-style: italic;">without</span> breast cancer
that they have
a 7.8% chance of having cancer, thus creating twelve times as much
additional fear and uncertainty.&nbsp; The new test, mammography+, does
<span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> give 950 women false
positives,
and the 80 women with cancer are told the same facts they would have
learned eventually, only earlier and without an intervening period of
uncertainty.&nbsp; Mammography+ is thus a better test in terms of its
total emotional impact on patients, as well as being more
accurate.&nbsp; Regardless of its emotional impact, it remains a fact
that a patient with positive mammography+ has a 99.988% chance of
having
breast cancer.<br> 
<br> 
Of course, that mammography+ does <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> 
give 950 healthy women false positives means that all 80 of the
patients
with positive mammography+ will be patients with breast cancer.&nbsp;
Thus, if you have a positive mammography+, your chance of having cancer
is a virtual certainty.&nbsp; It is <span style="font-style: italic;">because</span> 
mammography+ does not generate as many false positives (and needless
emotional stress), that the (much smaller) group of patients who <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">do</span> get positive results will be
composed almost entirely of genuine cancer patients (who have bad news
coming to them regardless of when it arrives).<br> 
<br>

Similarly, let's suppose that we have a <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">less</span> discriminating test,
mammography*, that still has a 20% rate of false negatives, as in the
original case.&nbsp; However, mammography* has an 80% rate of false
positives.&nbsp; In other words, a patient <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">without </span>breast cancer has an 80%
chance of getting a false positive result on her mammography*
test.&nbsp; If we suppose the same 1% prior probability that a patient
presenting herself for screening has breast cancer, what is the chance
that a patient with positive mammography* has cancer?<br> 
<ul> 
  <li>Group 1:&nbsp; 100 patients with breast cancer.</li> 
  <li>Group 2:&nbsp; 9,900 patients without breast cancer.<br> 
  </li> 
</ul> 
After mammography* screening:<br> 
<ul> 
  <li>Group A:&nbsp; 80 patients with breast cancer and a "positive"
mammography*.</li> 
  <li>Group B:&nbsp; 20 patients with breast cancer and a "negative"
mammography*.</li> 
  <li>Group C:&nbsp; 7920 patients without breast cancer and a
"positive" mammography*.</li> 
  <li>Group D:&nbsp; 1980 patients without breast cancer and a
"negative" mammography*.<br> 
  </li> 
</ul> 
<form> Calculator: <input name="expression" value="80 / (80 + 7920)"
 onchange="compute(this.form)" onkeyup="compute(this.form)" size="50"> 
Result: <input name="result" size="5"> <input type="button"
 name="computeButton" value="Compute!" onclick="compute(this.form)"><br> 
</form> 
The result works out to 80 / 8,000, or 0.01.&nbsp; This is exactly the
same as the 1% prior probability that a patient has breast
cancer!&nbsp;
A "positive" result on mammography* doesn't change the probability that
a woman has breast cancer at all.&nbsp; You can similarly verify that a
"negative" mammography* also counts for nothing.&nbsp; And in fact it <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">must</span> be this way, because if
mammography* has an 80% hit rate for patients with breast cancer, and
also an 80% rate of false positives for patients without breast cancer,
then mammography* is completely <span style="font-style: italic;">uncorrelated</span> 
with breast cancer.&nbsp; There's no reason to call one result
"positive" and one result "negative"; in fact, there's no reason to
call
the test a "mammography".&nbsp; You can throw away your expensive
mammography* equipment and replace it with a random number generator
that outputs a red light 80% of the time and a green light 20% of the
time; the results will be the same.&nbsp; Furthermore, there's no
reason
to call the red light a "positive" result or the green light a
"negative" result.&nbsp; You could have a green light 80% of the time
and a red light 20% of the time, or a blue light 80% of the time and a
purple light 20% of the time, and it would all have the same bearing on
whether the patient has breast cancer: i.e., no bearing whatsoever.<br> 
<br> 
We can show algebraically that this <span style="font-style: italic;">must</span> 
hold for any case where the chance of a true positive and the chance of
a false positive are the same, i.e:<br> 
<ul> 
  <li>Group 1:&nbsp; 100 patients with breast cancer.</li> 
  <li>Group 2:&nbsp; 9,900 patients without breast cancer.<br> 
  </li> 
</ul> 
Now consider a test where the probability of a true positive and the
probability of a false positive are the same number M (in the example
above, M=80% or M = 0.8):<br> 
<ul> 
  <li>Group A:&nbsp; 100*M patients with breast cancer and a "positive"
result.<br> 
  </li> 
  <li>Group B:&nbsp; 100*(1 - M) patients with breast cancer and a
"negative" result.</li> 
  <li>Group C:&nbsp; 9,900*M patients without breast cancer and a
"positive" result.</li> 
  <li>Group D:&nbsp; 9,900*(1 - M) patients without breast cancer and a
"negative" result.<br> 
  </li> 
</ul> 
The proportion of patients with breast cancer, within the group of
patients with a "positive" result, then equals 100*M / (100*M + 9900*M)
= 100 / (100 + 9900) = 1%.&nbsp; This holds true regardless of whether
M
is 80%, 30%, 50%, or 100%.&nbsp; If we have a mammography* test that
returns "positive" results for 90% of patients with breast cancer and
returns "positive" results for 90% of patients without breast cancer,
the proportion of "positive"-testing patients who have breast cancer
will still equal the original proportion of patients with breast
cancer,
i.e., 1%.<br> 
<br> 
You can run through the same algebra, replacing the prior proportion of
patients with breast cancer with an arbitrary percentage P:<br> 
<ul> 
  <li>Group 1:&nbsp; Within some number of patients, a fraction P have
breast cancer.</li> 
  <li>Group 2:&nbsp; Within some number of patients, a fraction (1 - P)
do not have breast cancer.</li> 
</ul> 
After a "cancer test" that returns "positive" for a fraction M of
patients with breast cancer, and also returns "positive" for the same
fraction M of patients <span style="font-style: italic;">without</span> 
cancer:<br> 
<ul> 
  <li>Group A:&nbsp; P*M patients have breast cancer and a "positive"
result.<br> 
  </li> 
  <li>Group B:&nbsp; P*(1 - M) patients have breast cancer and a
"negative" result.</li> 
  <li>Group C:&nbsp; (1 - P)*M patients have no breast cancer and a
"positive" result.</li> 
  <li>Group D:&nbsp; (1 - P)*(1 - M) patients have no breast cancer and
a "negative" result.<br> 
  </li> 
</ul> 
The chance that a patient with a "positive" result has breast cancer is
then the proportion of group A within the combined group A + C, or P*M
/
[P*M + (1 - P)*M], which, cancelling the common factor M from the
numerator and denominator, is P / [P + (1 - P)] or P / 1 or just
P.&nbsp; If the rate of false positives is the same as the rate of true
positives, you always have the same probability after the test as when
you started.<br> 
<br> 
Which is common sense.&nbsp; Take, for example, the "test" of flipping
a coin; if the coin comes up heads, does it tell you anything about
whether a patient has breast cancer?&nbsp; No; the coin has a 50%
chance
of coming up heads if the patient has breast cancer, and also a 50%
chance of coming up heads if the patient does not have breast
cancer.&nbsp; Therefore there is no reason to call either heads or
tails
a "positive" result.&nbsp; It's not the probability being "50/50" that
makes the coin a bad test; it's that the two probabilities, for "cancer
patient turns up heads" and "healthy patient turns up heads", are the
same.&nbsp; If the coin was slightly biased, so that it had a 60%
chance
of coming up heads, it still wouldn't be a cancer test - what makes a
coin a poor test is not that it has a 50/50 chance of coming up heads
if
the patient has cancer, but that it also has a 50/50 chance of coming
up
heads if the patient does not have cancer.&nbsp; You can even use a
test
that comes up "positive" for cancer patients 100% of the time, and
still
not learn anything.&nbsp; An example of such a test is "Add 2 + 2 and
see if the answer is 4."&nbsp; This test returns positive 100% of the
time for patients with breast cancer.&nbsp; It also returns positive
100% of the time for patients without breast cancer.&nbsp; So you learn
nothing.<br>

The original proportion of patients with breast cancer is known as the <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">prior probability.</span>&nbsp; The chance
that a patient with breast cancer gets a positive mammography, and the
chance that a patient without breast cancer gets a positive
mammography,
are known as the two <span style="font-style: italic;">conditional
probabilities.</span>&nbsp; Collectively, this initial information is
known as <span style="font-style: italic;">the priors</span><span 
 style="font-style: italic;">.</span>&nbsp; The final answer - the
estimated probability that a patient has breast cancer, given that we
know she has a positive result on her mammography - is known as the <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">revised probability</span> or the <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">posterior probability.</span>&nbsp; What
we've just shown is that <span style="font-style: italic;">if the two

Actually, priors are true or false just like the final answer - they
reflect reality and can be judged by comparing them against
reality.&nbsp; For example, if you think that 920 out of 10,000 women
in
a sample have breast cancer, and the actual number is 100 out of
10,000,
then your priors are wrong.&nbsp; For our particular problem, the
priors
might have been established by three studies - a study on the case
histories of women with breast cancer to see how many of them tested
positive on a mammography, a study on women without breast cancer to
see
how many of them test positive on a mammography, and an epidemiological
study on the prevalence of breast cancer in some specific demographic.<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br> 
Suppose that a barrel contains many small plastic eggs.&nbsp; Some eggs
are painted red and some are painted blue.&nbsp; 40% of the eggs in the
bin contain pearls, and 60% contain nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; 30% of eggs
containing pearls are painted blue, and 10% of eggs containing nothing
are painted blue.&nbsp; What is the probability that a blue egg
contains
a pearl?&nbsp; For this example the arithmetic is simple enough that
you
may be able to do it in your head, and I would suggest trying to do so.<br> 
<br> 
<form> But just in case... <input type="text" name="expression"
 value="(1 + 2) * 3 + 4" onchange="compute(this.form)"
 onkeyup="compute(this.form)" size="50"> Result: <input name="result"
 size="5" value=""> <input type="button" name="computeButton"
 value="Compute!" onclick="compute(this.form)"> </form> 
A more compact way of specifying the problem:<br> 
<ul> 
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">p(pearl) = 40%</li> 
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">p(blue|pearl) = 30%</li> 
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">p(blue|~pearl) = 10%</li> 
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">p(pearl|blue) = ?</span><br> 
  </li> 
</ul> 
<span style="font-family: monospace;">"~"</span> is shorthand for
"not",
so <span style="font-family: monospace;">~pearl</span> reads "not
pearl".<br> 
<br> 
<span style="font-family: monospace;">blue|pearl</span> is shorthand
for
"blue given pearl" or "the probability that an egg is painted blue,
given that the egg contains a pearl".&nbsp; One thing that's confusing
about this notation is that the order of implication is read
right-to-left, as in Hebrew or Arabic.&nbsp; <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">blue|pearl</span> means "blue<span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;-</span>pearl", the degree to
which pearl-ness implies blue-ness, not the degree to which blue-ness
implies pearl-ness.&nbsp; This is confusing, but it's unfortunately the
standard notation in probability theory.<br> 
<br> 
Readers familiar with quantum mechanics will have already encountered
this peculiarity; in quantum mechanics, for example, <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;d|c&gt;&lt;c|b&gt;&lt;b|a&gt;</span> 
reads as "the probability that a particle at A goes to B, then to C,
ending up at D".&nbsp; To follow the particle, you move your eyes from
right to left.&nbsp; Reading from left to right, <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">"|"</span> means "given"; reading from
right to left, <span style="font-family: monospace;">"|"</span> means
"implies" or "leads to".&nbsp; Thus, moving your eyes from left to
right, <span style="font-family: monospace;">blue|pearl</span> reads
"blue given pearl" or "the probability that an egg is painted blue,
given that the egg contains a pearl".&nbsp; Moving your eyes from right
to left, <span style="font-family: monospace;">blue|pearl</span> reads
"pearl implies blue" or "the probability that an egg containing a pearl
is painted blue".<br> 
<br> 
The item on the right side is what you <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">already know</span> or the <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">premise,</span> and the item on the left
side is the <span style="font-style: italic;">implication</span> or <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">conclusion.</span>&nbsp; If we have <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(blue|pearl) = 30%</span>, and we <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">already know</span> that some egg contains
a pearl, then we can <span style="font-style: italic;">conclude </span>there
is a 30% chance that the egg is painted blue.&nbsp; Thus, the final
fact we're looking for - "the chance that a blue egg contains a pearl"
or "the probability that an egg contains a pearl, if we know the egg is
painted blue" - reads <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(pearl|blue)</span>.<br> 
<br> 
Let's return to the problem.&nbsp; We have that 40% of the eggs contain
pearls, and 60% of the eggs contain nothing.&nbsp; 30% of the eggs
containing pearls are painted blue, so 12% of the eggs altogether
contain pearls and are painted blue.&nbsp; 10% of the eggs containing
nothing are painted blue, so altogether 6% of the eggs contain nothing
and are painted blue.&nbsp; A total of 18% of the eggs are painted
blue,
and a total of 12% of the eggs are painted blue and contain pearls, so
the chance a blue egg contains a pearl is 12/18 or 2/3 or around 67%.<br>

Looking at this applet, it's easier to see why the final answer depends
on all three probabilities; it's the <span style="font-style: italic;">differential
pressure</span> between the two conditional probabilities,&nbsp; <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(blue|pearl)</span> and <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(blue|~pearl)</span>, that <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">slides </span>the prior probability <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(pearl)</span> to the posterior
probability <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(pearl|blue)</span>.<br> 
<br> 
As before, we can see the necessity of all three pieces of information
by considering extreme cases (feel free to type them into the
applet).&nbsp; In a (large) barrel in which only one egg out of a
thousand contains a pearl, knowing that an egg is painted blue slides
the probability from 0.1% to 0.3% (instead of sliding the probability
from 40% to 67%).&nbsp; Similarly, if 999 out of 1000 eggs contain
pearls, knowing that an egg is blue slides the probability from 99.9%
to
99.966%; the probability that the egg does <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">not</span> contain a pearl goes from
1/1000
to around 1/3000.&nbsp; Even when the prior probability changes, the
differential pressure of the two conditional probabilities always
slides
the probability in the same <span style="font-style: italic;">direction.</span>&nbsp;
If you learn the egg is painted blue, the probability the egg contains
a pearl always goes <span style="font-style: italic;">up</span> - but
it
goes up <span style="font-style: italic;">from</span> the prior
probability, so you need to know the prior probability in order to
calculate the final answer.&nbsp; 0.1% goes up to 0.3%, 10% goes up to
25%, 40% goes up to 67%, 80% goes up to 92%, and 99.9% goes up to
99.966%.&nbsp; If you're interested in knowing how any other
probabilities slide, you can type your own prior probability into the
Java applet.&nbsp; You can also click and drag the dividing line
between <span style="font-family: monospace;">pearl </span>and <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">~pearl</span> in the upper bar, and
watch the posterior probability change in the bottom bar.<br> 
<br> 
Studies of clinical reasoning show that most doctors carry out the
mental operation of <span style="font-style: italic;">replacing</span> 
the original 1% probability with the 80% probability that a woman with
cancer would get a positive mammography.&nbsp; Similarly, on the
pearl-egg problem, most respondents unfamiliar with Bayesian reasoning
would probably respond that the probability a blue egg contains a pearl
is 30%, or perhaps 20% (the 30% chance of a true positive minus the 10%
chance of a false positive).&nbsp; Even if this mental operation seems
like a good idea at the time, it makes no sense in terms of the
question
asked.&nbsp; It's like the experiment in which you ask a
second-grader:&nbsp; "If eighteen people get on a bus, and then seven
more people get on the bus, how old is the bus driver?"&nbsp; Many
second-graders will respond:&nbsp; "Twenty-five."&nbsp; They understand
when they're being prompted to carry out a particular mental procedure,
but they haven't quite connected the procedure to reality.&nbsp;
Similarly, to find the probability that a woman with a positive
mammography has breast cancer, it makes no sense whatsoever to <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">replace</span> the original probability
that the woman has cancer with the probability that a woman with breast
cancer gets a positive mammography.&nbsp; Neither can you subtract the
probability of a false positive from the probability of the true
positive.&nbsp; These operations are as wildly irrelevant as adding the
number of people on the bus to find the age of the bus driver.<br> 
<br> 
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br> 
I keep emphasizing the idea that evidence <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">slides</span> probability because of
research that shows people tend to use spatial intutions to grasp
numbers.&nbsp; In particular, there's interesting evidence that we have
an innate sense of quantity that's localized to left inferior parietal
cortex - patients with damage to this area can selectively lose their
sense of whether 5 is less than 8, while retaining their ability to
read, write, and so on.&nbsp; (Yes, really!)&nbsp; The parietal cortex
processes our sense of where things are in space (roughly speaking), so
an innate "number line", or rather "quantity line", may be responsible
for the human sense of numbers.&nbsp; This is why I suggest visualizing
Bayesian evidence as <span style="font-style: italic;">sliding</span> 
the probability along the number line; my hope is that this will
translate Bayesian reasoning into something that makes sense to innate
human brainware.&nbsp; (That, really, is what an "intuitive
explanation" <span style="font-style: italic;">is.</span>)&nbsp; For
more information,
see Stanislas Dehaene's <span style="font-style: italic;">The Number
Sense.<br> 
<br> 
</span> 
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br> 
A study by Gigerenzer and Hoffrage in 1995 showed that some ways of
phrasing story problems are much more evocative of correct Bayesian
reasoning.&nbsp; The <span style="font-style: italic;">least</span> 
evocative phrasing used probabilities.&nbsp; A slightly more evocative
phrasing used frequencies instead of probabilities; the problem
remained
the same, but instead of saying that 1% of women had breast cancer, one
would say that 1 out of 100 women had breast cancer, that 80 out of 100
women with breast cancer would get a positive mammography, and so
on.&nbsp; Why did a higher proportion of subjects display Bayesian
reasoning on this problem?&nbsp; Probably because saying "1 out of 100
women" encourages you to concretely visualize X women with cancer,
leading you to visualize X women with cancer and a positive
mammography,
etc.<br> 
<br> 
The most effective presentation found so far is what's known as <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">natural frequencies</span> - saying that
40
out of 100 eggs contain pearls, 12 out of 40 eggs containing pearls are
painted blue, and 6 out of 60 eggs containing nothing are painted
blue.&nbsp; A <span style="font-style: italic;">natural frequencies</span> 
presentation is one in which the information about the prior
probability
is included in presenting the conditional probabilities.&nbsp; If you
were just learning about the eggs' conditional probabilities through
natural experimentation, you would - in the course of cracking open a
hundred eggs - crack open around 40 eggs containing pearls, of which 12
eggs would be painted blue, while cracking open 60 eggs containing
nothing, of which about 6 would be painted blue.&nbsp; In the course of
learning the conditional probabilities, you'd see examples of blue eggs
containing pearls about twice as often as you saw examples of blue eggs
containing nothing.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br> 
<br> 
It may seem like presenting the problem in this way is "cheating", and
indeed if it were a story problem in a math book, it probably <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">would</span> be cheating.&nbsp; However,
if
you're talking about real doctors, you <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">want</span> 
to cheat; you <span style="font-style: italic;">want</span> the
doctors
to draw the right conclusions as easily as possible.&nbsp; The obvious
next move would be to present all medical statistics in terms of
natural
frequencies.&nbsp; Unfortunately, while natural frequencies are a step
in the right direction, it probably won't be enough.&nbsp; When
problems
are presented in natural frequences, the proportion of people using
Bayesian reasoning rises to around half.&nbsp; A big improvement, but
not big enough when you're talking about real doctors and real patients.<span

In the frequency visualization, the <span style="font-style: italic;">selective
attrition</span> of the two conditional probabilities changes the <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">proportion</span> of eggs that contain
pearls.&nbsp; The bottom bar is shorter than the top bar, just as the
number of eggs painted blue is less than the total number of
eggs.&nbsp;
The probability graph shown earlier is really just the frequency graph
with the bottom bar "renormalized", stretched out to the same length as
the top bar.&nbsp; In the frequency applet you can change the
conditional probabilities by clicking and dragging the left and right
edges of the graph.&nbsp; (For example, to change the conditional
probability <span style="font-family: monospace;">blue|pearl</span>,
click and drag the line on the left that stretches from the left edge
of
the top bar to the left edge of the bottom bar.)<br> 
<br> 
In the probability applet, you can see that when the conditional
probabilities are equal, there's no <span style="font-style: italic;">differential</span> 
pressure - the arrows are the same size - so the prior probability
doesn't slide between the top bar and the bottom bar.&nbsp; But the
bottom bar in the probability applet is just a renormalized (stretched
out) version of the bottom bar in the frequency applet, and the
frequency applet shows <span style="font-style: italic;">why</span> 
the
probability doesn't slide if the two conditional probabilities are
equal.&nbsp; Here's a case where the prior proportion of pearls remains
40%, and the proportion of pearl eggs painted blue remains 30%, but the
number of empty eggs painted blue is also 30%:<br>

If you diminish two shapes by the same factor, their relative
proportion will be the same as before.&nbsp; If you diminish the left
section of the top bar by the same factor as the right section, then
the
bottom bar will have the same proportions as the top bar - it'll just
be
smaller.&nbsp; If the two conditional probabilities are equal, learning
that the egg is blue doesn't change the probability that the egg
contains a pearl - for the same reason that similar triangles have
identical angles; geometric figures don't change shape when you shrink
them by a constant factor.<br> 
<br> 
In this case, you might as well just say that <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">30% of eggs are painted blue,</span> since
the probability of an egg being painted blue is independent of whether
the egg contains a pearl.&nbsp; Applying a "test" that is statistically
independent of its condition just shrinks the sample size.&nbsp; In
this
case, requiring that the egg be painted blue doesn't shrink the group
of
eggs with pearls any more or less than it shrinks the group of eggs
without pearls.&nbsp; It just shrinks the total number of eggs in the
sample.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br>

Here's what the original medical problem looks like when graphed.&nbsp;
1% of women have breast cancer, 80% of those women test positive on a
mammography, and 9.6% of women without breast cancer also receive
positive mammographies.<br>

As is now clearly visible, the mammography doesn't increase the
probability a positive-testing woman has breast cancer by increasing
the
number of women with breast cancer - of course not; if mammography
increased the number of women with breast cancer, no one would ever
take
the test!&nbsp; However, <span style="font-style: italic;">requiring </span>a
positive mammography is a membership test that <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">eliminates</span> many more women without
breast cancer than women with cancer.&nbsp; The number of women without
breast cancer diminishes by a factor of more than ten, from 9,900 to
950, while the number of women with breast cancer is diminished only
from 100 to 80.&nbsp; Thus, the proportion of 80 within 1,030 is much
larger than the proportion of 100 within 10,000.&nbsp; In the graph,
the
left sector (representing women with breast cancer) is small, but the
mammography test projects almost all of this sector into the bottom
bar.&nbsp; The right sector (representing women without breast cancer)
is large, but the mammography test projects a much smaller fraction <span 
 style="font-style: italic;"></span>of this sector into the bottom
bar.&nbsp; There are, indeed, fewer women with breast cancer and
positive mammographies than there are women with breast cancer -
obeying
the law of probabilities which requires that <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(A) &gt;= p(A&amp;B)</span>.&nbsp;
But even though the left sector in the bottom bar is actually slightly
smaller, the proportion of the left sector <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">within</span> the bottom bar is greater -
though still not very great.&nbsp; If the bottom bar were renormalized
to the same length as the top bar, it would look like the left sector
had expanded.&nbsp; This is why the proportion of "women with breast
cancer" in the group "women with positive mammographies" is higher than
the proportion of "women with breast cancer" in the general population
-
although the proportion is still not very high.&nbsp; The evidence of
the positive mammography slides the prior probability of 1% to the
posterior probability of 7.8%.<br> 
<br> 
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br> 
Suppose there's yet another variant of the mammography test,
mammography@, which behaves as follows.&nbsp; 1% of women in a certain
demographic have breast cancer.&nbsp; Like ordinary mammography,
mammography@ returns positive 9.6% of the time for women without breast
cancer.&nbsp; However, mammography@ returns positive 0% of the time
(say, once in a billion) for women with breast cancer.&nbsp; The graph
for this scenario looks like this:<br>

What is it that this test actually does?&nbsp; If a patient comes to
you with a positive result on her mammography@, what do you say?<br> 
<br> 
<hr style="height: 4px; width: 50%;"><br> 
"Congratulations, you're among the rare 9.5% of the population whose
health is definitely established by this test."<br> 
<br> 
Mammography@ isn't a cancer test; it's a health test!&nbsp; Few women
without breast cancer get positive results on mammography@, but <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">only</span> women without breast cancer
ever get positive results at all.&nbsp; Not much of the right sector of
the top bar projects into the bottom bar, but <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">none</span> of the left sector projects
into the bottom bar.&nbsp; So a positive result on mammography@ means
you <span style="font-style: italic;">definitely </span>don't have
breast cancer.<br> 
<br> 
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br> 
What makes ordinary mammography a <span style="font-style: italic;">positive</span> 
indicator for breast cancer is not that someone <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">named</span> the result "positive", but
rather that the test result stands in a specific Bayesian relation to
the condition of breast cancer.&nbsp; You could call the same result
"positive" or "negative" or "blue" or "red" or "James Rutherford", or
give it no name at all, and the test result would still slide the
probability in exactly the same way.&nbsp; To minimize confusion, a
test
result which slides the probability of breast cancer upward should be
called "positive".&nbsp; A test result which slides the probability of
breast cancer downward should be called "negative".&nbsp; If the test
result is statistically unrelated to the presence or absence of breast
cancer - if the two conditional probabilities are equal - then we
shouldn't call the procedure a "cancer test"!&nbsp; The <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">meaning</span> of the test is determined
by
the two conditional probabilities; any names attached to the results
are
simply convenient labels.<br>

The bottom bar for the graph of mammography@ is small; mammography@ is
a test that's only rarely useful.&nbsp; Or rather, the test only rarely
gives <span style="font-style: italic;">strong</span> evidence, and
most
of the time gives <span style="font-style: italic;">weak</span> 
evidence.&nbsp; A negative result on mammography@ does slide
probability
- it just doesn't slide it very far.&nbsp; Click the "Result" switch at
the bottom left corner of the applet to see what a <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">negative</span> result on mammography@
would imply.&nbsp; You might intuit that since the test <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">could</span> have returned positive for
health, but didn't, then the failure of the test to return positive
must
mean that the woman has a higher chance of having breast cancer - that
her probability of having breast cancer must be slid upward by the
negative result on her health test.<br> 
<br> 
This intuition is correct!&nbsp; The sum of the groups with negative
results and positive results must always equal the group of all
women.&nbsp; If the positive-testing group has "more than its fair
share" of women <span style="font-style: italic;">without </span>breast
cancer, there must be an at least slightly higher proportion of women <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">with</span> cancer in the negative-testing
group.&nbsp; A positive result is rare but very strong evidence in one
direction, while a negative result is common but very weak evidence in
the opposite direction.&nbsp; You might call this the Law of
Conservation of Probability - not a standard term, but the conservation
rule is exact.&nbsp; If you take the revised probability of breast
cancer after a positive result, times the <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">probability </span>of a positive result,
and add that to the revised probability of breast cancer after a
negative result, times the <span style="font-style: italic;">probability</span> 
of a negative result, then you must always arrive at the prior
probability.&nbsp; If you don't yet <span style="font-style: italic;">know</span> 
what the test result is, the <span style="font-style: italic;">expected
revised probability</span> after the test result arrives - taking both
possible results into account - should always equal the prior
probability.<br> 
<br> 
On ordinary mammography, the test is expected to return "positive"
10.3% of the time - 80 positive women with cancer plus 950 positive
women without cancer equals 1030 women with positive results.&nbsp;
Conversely, the mammography should return negative 89.7% of the
time:&nbsp; 100% - 10.3% = 89.7%.&nbsp; A positive result slides the
revised probability from 1% to 7.8%, while a negative result slides the
revised probability from 1% to 0.22%.&nbsp; So <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(cancer|positive)*p(positive)</span> 
+ <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(cancer|negative)*p(negative)
=
7.8%*10.3% + 0.22%*89.7% = 1% = p(cancer)</span>, as expected.<br>

One of the common confusions in using Bayesian reasoning is to mix up
some or all of these quantities - which, as you can see, are all
numerically different and have different meanings.&nbsp; <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(A&amp;B)</span> is the same as <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(B&amp;A)</span>, but <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(A|B)</span> is not the same thing as
<span style="font-family: monospace;">p(B|A)</span>, and <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(A&amp;B)</span> is completely
different from <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(A|B)</span>.&nbsp;
(I don't know who chose the symmetrical <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">"|"</span> symbol to mean "implies",
and then made the direction of implication right-to-left, but it was
probably a bad idea.)<br> 
<br> 
To get acquainted with all these quantities and the relationships
between them, we'll play "follow the degrees of freedom".&nbsp; For
example, the two quantities <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(cancer)</span> 
and <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(~cancer)</span> have 1
degree of freedom between them, because of the general law <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(A) + p(~A) = 1</span>.&nbsp; If you
know that <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(~cancer) = .99</span>,
you can obtain <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(cancer) = 1 -
p(~cancer) = .01</span>.&nbsp; There's no room to say that <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(~cancer) = .99</span> and then also
specify <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(cancer) = .25</span>;
it would violate the rule <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(A) +
p(~A) = 1</span>.<br> 
<br> 
<span style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive|cancer)</span> and <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(~positive|cancer)</span> also have
only one degree of freedom between them; either a woman with breast
cancer gets a positive mammography or she doesn't.&nbsp; On the other
hand, <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive|cancer)</span> 
and <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive|~cancer)</span> 
have <span style="font-style: italic;">two</span> degrees of
freedom.&nbsp; You can have a mammography test that returns positive
for
80% of cancerous patients and 9.6% of healthy patients, or that returns
positive for 70% of cancerous patients and 2% of healthy patients, or
even a health test that returns "positive" for 30% of cancerous
patients
and 92% of healthy patients.&nbsp; The two quantities, the output of
the
mammography test for cancerous patients and the output of the
mammography test for healthy patients, are in mathematical terms
independent; one cannot be obtained from the other in any way, and so
they have two degrees of freedom between them.<br> 
<br> 
What about <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive&amp;cancer)</span>,<span 
 style="font-family: monospace;"> p(positive|cancer)</span>, and <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(cancer)</span>?&nbsp; Here we have
three quantities; how many degrees of freedom are there?&nbsp; In this
case the equation that must hold is <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive&amp;cancer) =
p(positive|cancer) * p(cancer)</span>.&nbsp; This equality reduces the
degrees of freedom by one.&nbsp; If we know the fraction of patients
with cancer, and chance that a cancerous patient has a positive
mammography, we can deduce the fraction of patients who have breast
cancer <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> a positive
mammography by multiplying.&nbsp; You should recognize this operation
from the graph; it's the projection of the top bar into the bottom
bar.&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(cancer)</span> is
the
left sector of the top bar, and <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive|cancer)</span> 
determines how much of that sector projects into the bottom bar, and
the
left sector of the bottom bar is <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive&amp;cancer)</span>.<br>

Similarly, if we know the number of patients with breast cancer and
positive mammographies, and also the number of patients with breast
cancer, we can estimate the chance that a woman with breast cancer gets
a positive mammography by dividing: <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive|cancer) =
p(positive&amp;cancer) / p(cancer)</span>.&nbsp; In fact, this is
exactly how such medical diagnostic tests are calibrated; you do a
study
on 8,520 women with breast cancer and see that there are 6,816 (or
thereabouts) women with breast cancer <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span>positive
mammographies, then divide 6,816 by 8520 to find that 80% of women with
breast cancer had positive mammographies.&nbsp; (Incidentally, if you
accidentally divide 8520 by 6,816 instead of the other way around, your
calculations will start doing strange things, such as insisting that
125% of women with breast cancer and positive mammographies have breast
cancer.&nbsp; This is a common mistake in carrying out Bayesian
arithmetic, in my experience.)&nbsp; And finally, if you know <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive&amp;cancer)</span> and <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive|cancer)</span>, you can
deduce how many cancer patients there must have been originally.&nbsp;
There are two degrees of freedom shared out among the three quantities;
if we know any two, we can deduce the third.<br> 
<br> 
How about <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive)</span>, <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive&amp;cancer)</span>, and <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive&amp;~cancer)</span>?&nbsp;
Again there are only two degrees of freedom among these three
variables.&nbsp; The equation occupying the extra degree of freedom is <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span>p(positive)
= p(positive&amp;cancer) + p(positive&amp;~cancer)</span>.&nbsp; This
is how <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive)</span> is
computed to begin with; we figure out the number of women with breast
cancer who have positive mammographies, and the number of women without
breast cancer who have positive mammographies, then add them together
to
get the total number of women with positive mammographies.&nbsp; It
would be very strange to go out and conduct a study to determine the
number of women with positive mammographies - just that one number and
nothing else - but in theory you could do so.&nbsp; And if you then
conducted another study and found the number of those women who had
positive mammographies <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> 
breast cancer, you would also know the number of women with positive
mammographies and <span style="font-style: italic;">no </span>breast
cancer - either a woman with a positive mammography has breast cancer
or
she doesn't.&nbsp; In general, <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(A&amp;B)
+ p(A&amp;~B) = p(A)</span>.&nbsp; Symmetrically, <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;"></span><span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(A&amp;B) + p(~A&amp;B) = p(B)</span>.<br> 
&nbsp;<br> 
What about <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive&amp;cancer)</span>,<span 
 style="font-family: monospace;"> p(positive&amp;~cancer)</span>, <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(~positive&amp;cancer)</span>, and <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(~positive&amp;~cancer)</span>?&nbsp;
You might at first be tempted to think that there are only two degrees
of freedom for these four quantities - that you can, for example, get <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive&amp;~cancer)</span> by
multiplying <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive) *
p(~cancer)</span>, and thus that all four quantities can be found given
only the two quantities <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive)</span> 
and <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(cancer)</span>.&nbsp; This
is not the case!&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive&amp;~cancer)
= p(positive) * p(~cancer)</span> only if the two probabilities are <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">statistically independent</span> - if the
chance that a woman has breast cancer has no bearing on whether she has
a positive mammography.&nbsp; As you'll recall, this amounts to
requiring that the two conditional probabilities be equal to each other
- a requirement which would eliminate one degree of freedom.&nbsp; If
you remember that these four quantities are the groups A, B, C, and D,
you can look over those four groups and realize that, in theory, you
can
put any number of people into the four groups.&nbsp; If you start with
a
group of 80 women with breast cancer and positive mammographies,
there's
no reason why you can't add another group of 500 women with breast
cancer and negative mammographies, followed by a group of 3 women
without breast cancer and negative mammographies, and so on.&nbsp; So
now it seems like the four quantities have four degrees of
freedom.&nbsp; And they would, except that in expressing them as <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">probabilities,</span> we need to normalize
them to <span style="font-style: italic;">fractions</span> of the
complete group, which adds the constraint that <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive&amp;cancer) + </span><span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive&amp;~cancer) + </span><span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(~positive&amp;cancer) + </span><span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(~positive&amp;~cancer) = 1</span>.&nbsp;
This equation takes up one degree of freedom, leaving three degrees of
freedom among the four quantities.&nbsp; If you specify the <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">fractions</span> of women in groups A, B,
and D, you can deduce the fraction of women in group C.<br> 
<br> 
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br> 
Given the four groups A, B, C, and D, it is very straightforward to
compute everything else:&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(cancer)
= A + B</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(~positive|cancer)
= B / (A + B)</span>, and so on.&nbsp; Since ABCD contains three
degrees of freedom, it follows that the entire set of 16 probabilities
contains only three degrees of freedom.&nbsp; Remember that in our
problems we always needed <span style="font-style: italic;">three</span> 
pieces of information - the prior probability and the two conditional
probabilities - which, indeed, have three degrees of freedom among
them.&nbsp; Actually, for Bayesian problems, <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">any</span> three quantities with three
degrees of freedom between them should logically specify the entire
problem.&nbsp; For example, let's take a barrel of eggs with <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(blue) = 0.40</span>,&nbsp; <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(blue|pearl) = 5/13</span>, and <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(~blue&amp;~pearl) = 0.20</span>.&nbsp;
Given this information, you <span style="font-style: italic;">can </span>compute<span 
 style="font-family: monospace;"> p(pearl|blue)</span>. <br> 
<br> 
As a story problem:<br> 
Suppose you have a large barrel containing a number of plastic
eggs.&nbsp; Some eggs contain pearls, the rest contain nothing.&nbsp;
Some eggs are painted blue, the rest are painted red.&nbsp; Suppose
that
40% of the eggs are painted blue, 5/13 of the eggs containing pearls
are
painted blue, and 20% of the eggs are both empty and painted red.&nbsp;
What is the probability that an egg painted blue contains a pearl?<br> 
<br> 
Try it - I assure you it is possible.<br> 
<br> 
<form>Calculator: <input name="expression" value="0"
 onchange="compute(this.form)" onkeyup="compute(this.form)" size="50"> 
Result: <input name="result" size="5" value=""> <input type="button"
 name="computeButton" value="Good luck!" onclick="compute(this.form)"> </form> 
You probably shouldn't try to solve this with just a Javascript
calculator, though.&nbsp; I used a Python console.&nbsp; (In theory,
pencil and paper should also work, but I don't know anyone who owns a
pencil so I couldn't try it personally.)<br> 
<br> 
As a check on your calculations, does the (meaningless) quantity <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(~pearl|~blue)/p(pearl)</span> 
roughly
equal .51?&nbsp; (In story problem terms:&nbsp; The likelihood that a
red egg is empty, divided by the likelihood that an egg contains a
pearl, equals approximately .51.)&nbsp; Of course, using this
information in the problem would be cheating.<!-- PC = 0.25, PH = 0.15, NC = 0.4, NH = 0.2 --><br> 
<br> 
If you can solve <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> 
problem,
then when we revisit Conservation of Probability, it seems perfectly
straightforward.&nbsp; Of course the mean revised probability, after
administering the test, must be the same as the prior
probability.&nbsp;
Of course strong but rare evidence in one direction must be
counterbalanced by common but weak evidence in the other direction.<br> 
<br> 
Because:<br> 
<span style="font-style: italic;"> <br> 
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp; </span></span><span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(cancer|positive)*p(positive)<br> 
+ p(cancer|~positive)*p(~positive)<br> 
= p(cancer)</span><br> 
<br> 
In terms of the four groups:<br> 
<br> 
<span style="font-family: monospace;">p(cancer|positive)&nbsp; = A / (A
+ C)<br> 
p(positive)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = A + C<br> 
</span><span style="font-family: monospace;">p(cancer&amp;positive)&nbsp;
= A<br> 
</span><span style="font-family: monospace;">p(cancer|~positive) = B /
(B + D)<br> 
p(~positive)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = B + D<br> 
</span><span style="font-family: monospace;">p(cancer&amp;~positive) = B<br> 
</span><span style="font-family: monospace;">p(cancer)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
= A + B<br> 
</span> <br> 
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br> 
Let's return to the original barrel of eggs - 40% of the eggs
containing pearls, 30% of the pearl eggs painted blue, 10% of the empty
eggs painted blue.&nbsp; The graph for this problem is:<br>

What happens to the revised probability, <span

proportion of eggs containing pearls is kept constant, but 60% of the
eggs with pearls are painted blue (instead of 30%), and 20% of the

eggs are painted blue (instead of 10%)?&nbsp; You could type 60% and
20%

graph changes - but can you figure out in advance what the change will
look like?<br>

bar grows by a factor of 2 but retains the same proportions,
congratulations!&nbsp; Take a moment to think about how far you've
come.&nbsp; Looking at a problem like<br> 
<br> 
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">1% of women have breast cancer.&nbsp;
80% of women with breast cancer get positive mammographies.&nbsp; 9.6%
of women without breast cancer get positive mammographies.&nbsp; If a
woman has a positive mammography, what is the probability she has
breast
cancer?<br> 
</div> 
<br> 
the vast majority of respondents intuit that around 70-80% of women
with positive mammographies have breast cancer.&nbsp; Now, looking at a
problem like<br> 
<br> 
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Suppose there are two barrels
containing many small plastic eggs.&nbsp; In both barrels, some eggs
are
painted blue and the rest are painted red.&nbsp; In both barrels, 40%
of
the eggs contain pearls and the rest are empty.&nbsp; In the first
barrel, 30% of the pearl eggs are painted blue, and 10% of the empty
eggs are painted blue.&nbsp; In the second barrel, 60% of the pearl
eggs
are painted blue, and 20% of the empty eggs are painted blue.&nbsp;
Would you rather have a blue egg from the first or second barrel?<br> 
</div> 
<br> 
you can see it's <span style="font-style: italic;">intuitively obvious</span> 
that the probability of a blue egg containing a pearl is the same for
either barrel.&nbsp; Imagine how hard it would be to see that using the
old way of thinking!<br> 
<br> 
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br> 
It's intuitively obvious, but how to prove it?&nbsp; Suppose that we
call P the prior probability that an egg contains a pearl, that we call
M the first conditional probability (that a pearl egg is painted blue),
and N the second conditional probability (that an empty egg is painted
blue).&nbsp; Suppose that M and N are both increased or diminished by
an
arbitrary factor X - for example, in the problem above, they are both
increased by a factor of 2.&nbsp; Does the revised probability that an
egg contains a pearl, given that we know the egg is blue, stay the same?<br> 
<ul style="font-family: monospace;"> 
  <li>p(pearl) = P</li> 
  <li>p(blue|pearl) = M*X</li> 
  <li>p(blue|~pearl) = N*X</li> 
  <li>p(pearl|blue) = ?<br> 
  </li> 
</ul> 
From these quantities, we get the four groups:<br> 
<ul> 
  <li>Group A:&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(pearl&amp;blue)&nbsp;&nbsp;
= P*M*X</span></li> 
  <li>Group B:&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(pearl&amp;~blue)&nbsp;
= P*(1 - (M*X))</span></li> 
  <li>Group C:&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(~pearl&amp;blue)&nbsp;
= (1 - P)*N*X</span></li> 
  <li>Group D:&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(~pearl&amp;~blue)
= (1 - P)*(1 - (N*X))</span></li> 
</ul> 
The proportion of eggs that contain pearls and are blue, within the
group of all blue eggs, is then the proportion of group (A) within the
group (A + C), equalling <span style="font-family: monospace;">P*M*X /
(P*M*X + (1 - P)*N*X)</span>.&nbsp; The factor X in the numerator and
denominator cancels out, so increasing or diminishing both conditional
probabilities by a constant factor doesn't change the revised
probability.<br>

As
a story problem, this strange fact would look something like this:<br> 
<br> 
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Suppose that there are two barrels,
each containing a number of plastic eggs.&nbsp; In both barrels, 40% of
the eggs contain pearls and the rest contain nothing.&nbsp; In both
barrels, some eggs are painted blue and the rest are painted red.&nbsp;
In the first barrel, 30% of the eggs with pearls are painted blue, and
10% of the empty eggs are painted blue.&nbsp; In the second barrel, 90%
of the eggs with pearls are painted blue, and 30% of the empty eggs are
painted blue.&nbsp; Would you rather have a blue egg from the first or
second barrel?&nbsp; Would you rather have a red egg from the first or
second barrel?<br> 
</div> 
<br> 
For the first question, the answer is that we don't care whether we get
the blue egg from the first or second barrel.&nbsp; For the second
question, however, the probabilities <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> 
change - in the first barrel, 34% of the red eggs contain pearls, while
in the second barrel 8.7% of the red eggs contain pearls!&nbsp; Thus,
we
should prefer to get a red egg from the first barrel.&nbsp; In the
first
barrel, 70% of the pearl eggs are painted red, and 90% of the empty
eggs
are painted red.&nbsp; In the second barrel, 10% of the pearl eggs are
painted red, and 70% of the empty eggs are painted red.<br>

What goes on here?&nbsp; We start out by noting that, counter to
intuition, <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(pearl|blue)</span> 
and <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(pearl|~blue)</span> have
two
degrees of freedom among them even when <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(pearl)</span> is fixed - so there's
no reason why one quantity shouldn't change while the other remains
constant.&nbsp; But we didn't we just get through establishing a law
for
"Conservation of Probability", which says that <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(pearl|blue)*p(blue) +
p(pearl|~blue)*p(~blue) = p(pearl)</span>?&nbsp; Doesn't this equation
take up one degree of freedom?&nbsp; No, because <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(blue)</span> isn't fixed between the
two problems.&nbsp; In the second barrel, the proportion of blue eggs
containing pearls is the same as in the first barrel, but a much larger
fraction of eggs are painted blue!&nbsp; This alters the set of <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">red</span> eggs in such a way that the
proportions <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> change.&nbsp;

Let's return to the example of a medical test.&nbsp; The likelihood
ratio of a medical test - the number of true positives divided by the
number of false positives - tells us everything there is to know about
the <span style="font-style: italic;">meaning </span>of a <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">positive </span>result.&nbsp; But it
doesn't tell us the meaning of a negative result, and it doesn't tell
us
how often the test is useful.&nbsp; For example, a mammography with a
hit rate of 80% for patients with breast cancer and a false positive
rate of 9.6% for healthy patients has the same likelihood ratio as a
test with an 8% hit rate and a false positive rate of 0.96%.&nbsp;
Although these two tests have the same likelihood ratio, the first test
is more useful in every way - it detects disease more often, and a
negative result is stronger evidence of health.<br> 
<br> 
The likelihood ratio for a positive result summarizes the differential
pressure of the two conditional probabilities for a positive result,
and
thus summarizes how much a positive result will slide the prior
probability.&nbsp; Take a probability graph, like this one:<br>

The likelihood ratio of the mammography is what determines the slant of
the line.&nbsp; If the prior probability is 1%, then knowing only the
likelihood ratio is enough to determine the posterior probability after
a positive result.<br> 
<br> 
But, as you can see from the frequency graph, the likelihood ratio
doesn't tell the whole story - in the frequency graph, the <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">proportions </span>of the bottom bar can
stay fixed while the <span style="font-style: italic;">size</span> of
the bottom bar changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;"></span><span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(blue)</span> increases but <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(pearl|blue)</span> doesn't change,
because <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(pearl&amp;blue)</span> 
and <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(~pearl&amp;blue)</span> 
increase by the same factor.&nbsp; But when you flip the graph to look
at <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(~blue)</span>, the
proportions of <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(pearl&amp;~blue)</span> 
and <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(~pearl&amp;~blue)</span> 
do <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> remain constant.<br> 
<br> 
Of course the likelihood ratio <span style="font-style: italic;">can't</span> 
tell the whole story; the likelihood ratio and the prior probability
together are only two numbers, while the problem has three degrees of
freedom.<br> 
<br> 
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br> 
Suppose that you apply <span style="font-style: italic;">two</span> 
tests for breast cancer in succession - say, a standard mammography and
also some other test which is independent of mammography.&nbsp; Since I
don't know of any such test which is <span style="font-style: italic;">independent</span> 
of mammography, I'll invent one for the purpose of this problem, and
call it the Tams-Braylor Division Test, which checks to see if any
cells
are dividing more rapidly than other cells.&nbsp; We'll suppose that
the
Tams-Braylor gives a true positive for 90% of patients with breast
cancer, and gives a false positive for 5% of patients without
cancer.&nbsp; Let's say the prior prevalence of breast cancer is
1%.&nbsp; If a patient gets a positive result on her mammography <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">and</span> her Tams-Braylor, what is the
revised probability she has breast cancer?<br> 
<br> 
One way to solve this problem would be to take the revised probability
for a positive mammography, which we already calculated as 7.8%, and
plug that into the Tams-Braylor test as the new prior
probability.&nbsp;
If we do this, we find that the result comes out to 60%.<br> 
<br> 
<form> Calculator: <input type="text" name="expression"
 value="(1 + 2) * 3 + 4" onchange="compute(this.form)"
 onkeyup="compute(this.form)" size="50"> Result: <input name="result"
 size="5"> <input type="button" name="computeButton" value="Compute!"
 onclick="compute(this.form)"> </form> 
But this assumes that first we see the positive mammography result, and
then the positive result on the Tams-Braylor.&nbsp; What if first the
woman gets a positive result on the Tams-Braylor, followed by a
positive
result on her mammography.&nbsp; Intuitively, it seems like it
shouldn't
matter.&nbsp; Does the math check out?<br> 
<br> 
First we'll administer the Tams-Braylor to a woman with a 1% prior
probability of breast cancer.&nbsp; <br> 
<br> 
<form> Calculator: <input type="text" name="expression"
 value="(1 + 2) * 3 + 4" onchange="compute(this.form)"
 onkeyup="compute(this.form)" size="50"> Result: <input name="result"
 size="5"> <input type="button" name="computeButton" value="Compute!"
 onclick="compute(this.form)"> </form> 
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Then we administer a
mammography, which gives 80% true positives and 9.6% false positives,
and it also comes out positive.<br> 
<br> 
<form> Calculator: <input type="text" name="expression"
 value="(1 + 2) * 3 + 4" onchange="compute(this.form)"
 onkeyup="compute(this.form)" size="50"> Result: <input name="result"
 size="5"> <input type="button" name="computeButton" value="Compute!"
 onclick="compute(this.form)"> </form> 
Lo and behold, the answer is again 60%.&nbsp; (If it's not exactly the
same, it's due to rounding error - you can get a more precise
calculator, or work out the fractions by hand, and the numbers will be
exactly equal.)<br> 
<br> 
An algebraic proof that both strategies are equivalent is left to the
reader.&nbsp; To visualize, imagine that the lower bar of the frequency
applet for mammography projects an even lower bar using the
probabilities of the Tams-Braylor Test, and that the final lowest bar
is
the same regardless of the order in which the conditional probabilities
are projected.<br> 
<br> 
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br> 
We might also reason that since the two tests are independent, the
probability a woman with breast cancer gets a positive mammography <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">and</span> a positive Tams-Braylor is 90%
*
80% = 72%.&nbsp; And the probability that a woman without breast cancer
gets false positives on mammography and Tams-Braylor is 5% * 9.6% =
0.48%.&nbsp; So if we wrap it all up as a single test with a likelihood
ratio of 72%/0.48%, and apply it to a woman with a 1% prior probability
of breast cancer:<br> 
<br> 
<form> Calculator: <input type="text" name="expression"
 value="(1 + 2) * 3 + 4" onchange="compute(this.form)"
 onkeyup="compute(this.form)" size="50"> Result: <input name="result"
 size="5"> <input type="button" name="computeButton" value="Compute!"
 onclick="compute(this.form)"> </form> 
...we find once again that the answer is 60%.<br> 
<br> 
Suppose that the prior prevalence of breast cancer in a demographic is
1%.&nbsp; Suppose that we, as doctors, have a repertoire of three
independent tests for breast cancer.&nbsp; Our first test, test A, a
mammography, has a likelihood ratio of 80%/9.6% = 8.33.&nbsp; The
second
test, test B, has a likelihood ratio of 18.0 (for example, from 90%
versus 5%); and the third test, test C, has a likelihood ratio of 3.5
(which could be from 70% versus 20%, or from 35% versus 10%; it makes
no
difference).&nbsp; Suppose a patient gets a positive result on all
three
tests.&nbsp; What is the probability the patient has breast cancer?<br> 
<br> 
Here's a fun trick for simplifying the bookkeeping.&nbsp; If the prior
prevalence of breast cancer in a demographic is 1%, then 1 out of 100
women have breast cancer, and 99 out of 100 women do not have breast
cancer.&nbsp; So if we rewrite the <span style="font-style: italic;">probability</span> 
of 1% as an <span style="font-style: italic;">odds ratio,</span> the
odds are:<br> 
<br> 
<span style="font-family: monospace;">1:99</span><br> 
<br> 
And the likelihood ratios of the three tests A, B, and C are:<br> 
<br> 
<span style="font-family: monospace;">8.33:1 = 25:3</span><br 
 style="font-family: monospace;"> 
<span style="font-family: monospace;">18.0:1 = 18:1</span><br 
 style="font-family: monospace;"> 
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;3.5:1 =&nbsp; 7:2</span><br> 
<br> 
The <span style="font-style: italic;">odds </span>for women with
breast cancer who score positive on all three tests, versus women
without breast cancer who score positive on all three tests, will equal:<br> 
<br> 
<span style="font-family: monospace;">1*25*18*7:99*3*1*2 =</span><br 
 style="font-family: monospace;"> 
<span style="font-family: monospace;">3,150:594</span><br> 
<br> 
To recover the probability from the odds, we just write:<br> 
<span style="font-family: monospace;">3,150 / (3,150 + 594) = 84%</span><br> 
<br> 
This always works regardless of how the odds ratios are written; i.e.,
8.33:1 is just the same as 25:3 or 75:9.&nbsp; It doesn't matter in
what
order the tests are administered, or in what order the results are
computed.&nbsp; The proof is left as an exercise for the reader.<br> 
<br> 
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br> 
E. T. Jaynes, in "Probability Theory With Applications in Science and
Engineering", suggests that credibility and evidence should be measured
in decibels.<br> 
<br> 
Decibels?<br> 
<br> 
Decibels are used for measuring exponential differences of
intensity.&nbsp; For example, if the sound from an automobile horn
carries 10,000 times as much energy (per square meter per second) as
the sound from an alarm clock, the automobile horn would be 40 decibels
louder.&nbsp; The sound of a bird singing might carry 1,000 times less
energy than an alarm clock, and hence would be 30 decibels
softer.&nbsp; To get the number of decibels,
you take the logarithm base 10 and multiply by 10.<br> 
<br> 
<span style="font-family: monospace;">decibels = 10 log<sub>10</sub> 
(intensity)<br> 
</span><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or</span><span 
 style="font-family: monospace;"><br> 
intensity = 10<sup>(decibels/10)</sup><br> 
</span><br> 
Suppose we start with a prior probability of 1% that a woman has breast
cancer, corresponding to an odds ratio of 1:99.&nbsp; And then we
administer three tests of likelihood ratios 25:3, 18:1, and 7:2.&nbsp;
You <span style="font-style: italic;">could </span>multiply those
numbers... or you could just add their logarithms:<br> 
<br> 
<span style="font-family: monospace;">10 log<sub>10</sub> (1/99) = -20<br> 
</span><span style="font-family: monospace;">10 log<sub>10</sub> (25/3)
= 9<br> 
</span><span style="font-family: monospace;">10 log<sub>10</sub> (18/1)
= 13<br> 
</span><span style="font-family: monospace;">10 log<sub>10</sub> 
(7/2)&nbsp; = 5</span><br> 
<br> 
It starts out as fairly unlikely that a woman has breast cancer - our
credibility level is at -20 decibels.&nbsp; Then three test results
come
in, corresponding to 9, 13, and 5 decibels of evidence.&nbsp; This
raises the credibility level by a total of 27 decibels, meaning that
the
prior credibility of -20 decibels goes to a posterior credibility of 7
decibels.&nbsp; So the odds go from 1:99 to 5:1, and the probability
goes from 1% to around 83%.<br> 
<br> 
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br> 
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">In front of you is a bookbag containing
1,000 poker chips.&nbsp; I started out with two such bookbags, one
containing 700 red and 300 blue chips, the other containing 300 red and
700 blue.&nbsp; I flipped a fair coin to determine which bookbag to
use,
so your prior probability that the bookbag in front of you is the red
bookbag is 50%.&nbsp; Now, you sample randomly, with replacement after
each chip.&nbsp; In 12 samples, you get 8 reds and 4 blues.&nbsp; What
is the probability that this is the predominantly red bag?<br> 
</div> 
<br> 
Just for fun, try and work this one out in your head.&nbsp; You don't
need to be exact - a rough estimate is good enough.&nbsp; When you're
ready, continue onward.<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br> 
According to a study performed by Lawrence Phillips and Ward Edwards in
1966, most people, faced with this problem, give an answer in the range
70% to 80%.&nbsp; Did you give a substantially higher probability than
that?&nbsp; If you did, congratulations - Ward Edwards wrote that very
seldom does a person answer this question properly, even if the person
is relatively familiar with Bayesian reasoning.&nbsp; The correct
answer
is 97%.<br> 
<br> 
The likelihood ratio for the test result "red chip" is 7/3, while the
likelihood ratio for the test result "blue chip" is 3/7.&nbsp;
Therefore
a blue chip is exactly the same amount of evidence as a red chip, just
in the other direction - a red chip is 3.6 decibels of evidence for the
red bag, and a blue chip is -3.6 decibels of evidence.&nbsp; If you
draw
one blue chip and one red chip, they cancel out.&nbsp; So the <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">ratio </span>of red chips to blue chips
does not matter; only the <span style="font-style: italic;">excess</span> 
of red chips over blue chips matters.&nbsp; There were eight red chips
and four blue chips in twelve samples; therefore, four <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">more</span> red chips than blue
chips.&nbsp; Thus the posterior odds will be:<br> 
<br> 
<span style="font-family: monospace;">7</span><sup 
 style="font-family: monospace;">4</sup><span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">:3</span><sup 
 style="font-family: monospace;">4</sup><span 
 style="font-family: monospace;"> = 2401:81<br> 
</span>which is around 30:1, i.e., around 97%.<br> 
<br> 
The prior credibility starts at 0 decibels and there's a total of
around 14 decibels of evidence, and indeed this corresponds to odds of
around 25:1 or around 96%.&nbsp; Again, there's some rounding error,
but
if you performed the operations using exact arithmetic, the results
would be identical.<br> 
<br> 
We can now see <span style="font-style: italic;">intuitively</span> 
that the bookbag problem would have exactly the same answer, obtained
in
just the same way, if sixteen chips were sampled and we found ten red
chips and six blue chips.<br>

Theorem?</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"> 
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> A.&nbsp; </span>The Reverend
Thomas Bayes, by far the most enigmatic figure in mathematical
history.&nbsp; Almost nothing is known of Bayes's life, and very few of
his manuscripts survived.&nbsp; Thomas Bayes was born in 1701 or 1702
to
Joshua Bayes and Ann Carpenter, and his date of death is listed as
1761.&nbsp; The exact date of Thomas Bayes's birth is not known for
certain because Joshua Bayes, though a surprisingly wealthy man, was a
member of an unusual, esoteric, and even heretical religious sect, the
"Nonconformists".&nbsp; The Nonconformists kept their birth registers
secret, supposedly from fear of religious discrimination; whatever the
reason, no true record exists of Thomas Bayes's birth.&nbsp; Thomas
Bayes was raised a Nonconformist and was soon promoted into the higher
ranks of the Nonconformist theosophers, whence comes the "Reverend" in
his name.<br> 
      <br> 
In 1742 Bayes was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, the
most prestigious scientific body of its day, despite Bayes having
published no scientific or mathematical works at that time.&nbsp;
Bayes's nomination certificate was signed by sponsors including the
President and the Secretary of the Society, making his election almost
certain.&nbsp; Even today, however, it remains a mystery <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">why</span> such weighty names sponsored an
unknown into the Royal Society.<br> 
      <br> 
Bayes's sole publication during his known lifetime was allegedly a
mystical book entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">Divine
Benevolence,</span> laying forth the original causation and ultimate
purpose of the universe.&nbsp; The book is commonly attributed to
Bayes,
though it is said that no author appeared on the title page, and the
entire work is sometimes considered to be of dubious provenance.<br> 
      <br> 
Most mysterious of all, Bayes' Theorem itself appears in a Bayes
manuscript presented to the Royal Society of London in 1764, <span 
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">three
years </span>after Bayes's supposed death in 1761!</span><br> 
      <br> 
Despite the shocking circumstances of its presentation, Bayes' Theorem
was soon forgotten, and was popularized within the scientific community
only by the later efforts of the great mathematician Pierre-Simon
Laplace.&nbsp; Laplace himself is almost as enigmatic as Bayes; we
don't
even know whether it was "Pierre" or "Simon" that was his actual first
name.&nbsp; Laplace's papers are said to have contained a design for an
AI capable of predicting all future events, the so-called "Laplacian
superintelligence".&nbsp; While it is generally believed that Laplace
never tried to implement his design, there remains the fact that
Laplace
presciently fled the guillotine that claimed many of his colleagues
during the Reign of Terror.&nbsp; Even today, physicists sometimes
attribute unusual effects to a "Laplacian Operator" intervening in
their
experiments.<br> 
      <br> 
In summary, we do not know the real circumstances of Bayes's birth, the
ultimate origins of Bayes' Theorem, Bayes's actual year of death, or
even whether Bayes ever really died.&nbsp; Nonetheless "Reverend Thomas
Bayes", whatever his true identity, has the greatest fondness and
gratitude of Earth's scientific community.</td>

So why is it that some people are so <span style="font-style: italic;">excited</span> 
about Bayes' Theorem?<br> 
<br> 
"Do you believe that a nuclear war will occur in the next 20 years?
&nbsp;If no, why not?"&nbsp; Since I wanted to use some common answers
to this question to make a point about rationality, I went ahead and
asked the above question in an IRC channel, #philosophy on EFNet.<br> 
<br> 
One EFNetter who answered replied "No" to the above question, but added
that he believed biological warfare would wipe out "99.4%" of humanity
within the next ten years. &nbsp;I then asked whether he believed 100%
was a possibility. &nbsp;"No," he said. &nbsp;"Why not?", I asked.
&nbsp;"Because I'm an optimist," he said.&nbsp; (Roanoke of #philosophy
on EFNet wishes to be credited with this statement, even having been
warned that it will not be cast in a complimentary light. &nbsp;Good
for
him!)&nbsp; Another person who answered the above question said that he
didn't expect a nuclear war for 100 years, because "All of the players
involved in decisions regarding nuclear war are not interested right
now." &nbsp;"But why extend that out for 100 years?", I asked.
&nbsp;"Pure hope," was his reply.<br> 
<br> 
What is it <span style="font-style: italic;">exactly</span> that makes
these thoughts "irrational" - a poor way of arriving at truth?&nbsp;
There are a number of intuitive replies that can be given to this; for
example:&nbsp; "It is not rational to believe things only because they
are comforting."&nbsp; Of course it is equally irrational to believe
things only because they are <span style="font-style: italic;">discomforting;</span> 
the second error is less common, but equally irrational.&nbsp; Other
intuitive arguments include the idea that "Whether or not you happen to
be an optimist has nothing to do with whether biological warfare wipes
out the human species", or "Pure hope is not evidence about nuclear war
because it is not an observation about nuclear war."<br> 
<br> 
There is also a mathematical reply that is precise, exact, and contains
all the intuitions as special cases.&nbsp; This mathematical reply is
known as Bayes' Theorem.<br> 
<br> 
For example, the reply "Whether or not you happen to be an optimist has
nothing to do with whether biological warfare wipes out the human
species" can be translated into the statement:<br> 
<br> 
p(you are currently an optimist | biological war occurs within ten
years and wipes out humanity) =<br> 
p(you are currently an optimist | biological war occurs within ten
years and does not wipe out humanity)<br> 
<br> 
Since the two probabilities for <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(X|A)</span> 
and <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(X|~A)</span> are equal,
Bayes' Theorem says that <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(A|X)
=
p(A)</span>; as we have earlier seen, when the two conditional
probabilities are equal, the revised probability equals the prior
probability.&nbsp; If X and A are unconnected - statistically
independent - then finding that X is true cannot be evidence that A is
true; observing X does not update our probability for A; saying "X" is
not an argument for A.<br> 
<br> 
But suppose you are arguing with someone who is verbally clever and who
says something like, "Ah, but since I'm an optimist, I'll have renewed
hope for tomorrow, work a little harder at my dead-end job, pump up the
global economy a little, eventually, through the trickle-down effect,
sending a few dollars into the pocket of the researcher who ultimately
finds a way to stop biological warfare - so you see, the two events are
related after all, and I can use one as valid evidence about the
other."&nbsp; In one sense, this is correct - <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">any</span> correlation, no matter how
weak,
is fair prey for Bayes' Theorem; <span style="font-style: italic;">but</span> 
Bayes' Theorem distinguishes between weak and strong evidence.&nbsp;
That is, Bayes' Theorem not only tells us what is and isn't evidence,
it
also describes the <span style="font-style: italic;">strength</span> 
of
evidence.&nbsp; Bayes' Theorem not only tells us <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">when</span> to revise our probabilities,
but <span style="font-style: italic;">how much</span> to revise our
probabilities.&nbsp; A correlation between hope and biological warfare
may exist, but it's a lot weaker than the speaker wants it to be; he is
revising his probabilities much too far.<br> 
<br> 
Let's say you're a woman who's just undergone a mammography.&nbsp;
Previously, you figured that you had a very small chance of having
breast cancer; we'll suppose that you read the statistics somewhere and
so you know the chance is 1%.&nbsp; When the positive mammography comes
in, your estimated chance should now shift to 7.8%.&nbsp; There is no
room to say something like, "Oh, well, a positive mammography isn't
definite evidence, some healthy women get positive mammographies
too.&nbsp; I don't want to despair too early, and I'm not going to
revise my probability until more evidence comes in.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;
Because I'm a optimist."&nbsp; And there is similarly no room for
saying, "Well, a positive mammography may not be definite evidence, but
I'm going to assume the worst until I find otherwise.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;
Because I'm a pessimist."&nbsp; Your revised probability should go to<span 
 style="font-style: italic;"></span> 7.8%, no more, no less.<br> 
<br> 
Bayes' Theorem describes what makes something "evidence" and how much
evidence it is.&nbsp; Statistical models are judged by comparison to
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bayesian method</span> because,
in
statistics, the Bayesian method is as good as it gets - the Bayesian
method defines the maximum amount of mileage you can get out of a given
piece of evidence, in the same way that thermodynamics defines the
maximum amount of work you can get out of a temperature
differential.&nbsp;
This is why you hear cognitive scientists talking about <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">Bayesian reasoners</span>.&nbsp; In
cognitive science, <span style="font-style: italic;">Bayesian reasoner</span> 
is the technically precise codeword that we use to mean <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">rational mind.</span><br> 
<br> 
There are also a number of general heuristics about human reasoning
that you can learn from looking at Bayes' Theorem.<br> 
<br> 
For example, in many discussions of Bayes' Theorem, you may hear
cognitive psychologists saying that people <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">do not take prior frequencies sufficiently
into account,</span> meaning that when people approach a problem where
there's some evidence X indicating that condition A might hold true,
they tend to judge A's likelihood solely by how well the evidence X
seems to match A, without taking into account the prior frequency of
A.&nbsp; If you think, for example, that under the mammography example,
the woman's chance of having breast cancer is in the range of 70%-80%,
then this kind of reasoning is insensitive to the prior frequency given
in the problem; it doesn't notice whether 1% of women or 10% of women
start out having breast cancer.&nbsp; "Pay more attention to the prior
frequency!" is one of the many things that humans need to bear in mind
to partially compensate for our built-in inadequacies.<br> 
<br> 
A related error is to pay too much attention to p(X|A) and not enough
to p(X|~A) when determining how much evidence X is for A.&nbsp; The
degree to which a result X is <i>evidence for A</i> depends, not only
on
the strength of the statement <i>we'd expect to see result X if A were
true,</i> but also on the strength of the statement <i>we <span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">wouldn't</span> expect to see result X if A
weren't true.</i>&nbsp; For example, if it is raining, this very
strongly implies the grass is wet <span style="font-family: monospace;">-
p(wetgrass|rain) ~ 1 </span>- but seeing that the grass is wet doesn't
necessarily mean that it has just rained; perhaps the sprinkler was
turned on, or you're looking at the early morning dew.&nbsp; Since <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(wetgrass|~rain)</span> is
substantially greater than zero, <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(rain|wetgrass)</span> 
is substantially less than one.&nbsp; On the other hand, if the grass
was <span style="font-style: italic;">never</span> wet when it wasn't
raining, then knowing that the grass was wet would <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">always</span> show that it was raining, <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(rain|wetgrass) ~ 1</span>, even if <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(wetgrass|rain) = 50%</span>; that
is, even if the grass only got wet 50% of the times it rained.&nbsp;
Evidence is always the result of the <span style="font-style: italic;">differential</span> 
between the two conditional probabilities.&nbsp; <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">Strong</span> evidence is not the product
of a very high probability that A leads to X, but the product of a very
<span style="font-style: italic;">low</span> probability that <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">not-A</span> could have led to X.<span 
 style="font-style: italic;"></span><br> 
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> <br> 
The <span style="font-style: italic;">Bayesian revolution in the
sciences</span> is fueled, not only by more and more cognitive
scientists suddenly noticing that mental phenomena have Bayesian
structure in them; not only by scientists in every field learning to
judge their statistical methods by comparison with the Bayesian method;
but also by the idea that <span style="font-style: italic;">science
itself is a special case of Bayes' Theorem; experimental evidence is
Bayesian evidence.</span>&nbsp; The Bayesian revolutionaries hold that
when you perform an experiment and get evidence that "confirms" or
"disconfirms" your theory, this confirmation and disconfirmation is
governed by the Bayesian rules.&nbsp; For example, you have to take
into
account, not only whether your theory predicts the phenomenon, but
whether other possible explanations also predict the phenomenon.&nbsp;
Previously, the most popular philosophy of science was probably Karl
Popper's <span style="font-style: italic;">falsificationism</span> -
this is the old philosophy that the Bayesian revolution is currently
dethroning.&nbsp; Karl Popper's idea that theories can be definitely
falsified, but never definitely confirmed, is yet another special case
of the Bayesian rules; if <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(X|A)
~ 1</span> - if the theory makes a definite prediction - then observing
~X very strongly falsifies A.&nbsp; On the other hand, if <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(X|A) ~ 1</span>,&nbsp; and we
observe X, this doesn't definitely confirm the theory; there might be
some other condition B such that <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(X|B)
~ 1</span>, in which case observing X doesn't favor A over B.&nbsp; For
observing X to definitely confirm A, we would have to know, not that <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(X|A) ~ 1</span>, but that <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(X|~A) ~ 0</span>, which is something
that we can't know because we can't range over all possible alternative
explanations.&nbsp; For example, when Einstein's theory of General
Relativity toppled Newton's incredibly well-confirmed theory of
gravity,
it turned out that all of Newton's predictions were just a special case
of Einstein's predictions.<br> 
<br> 
You can even formalize Popper's philosophy mathematically.&nbsp; The
likelihood ratio for X, <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(X|A)/p(X|~A)</span>,
determines how much observing X slides the probability for A; the
likelihood ratio is what says <span style="font-style: italic;">how
strong</span> X is as evidence.&nbsp; Well, in your theory A, you can
predict X with probability 1, if you like; but you can't control the
denominator of the likelihood ratio, <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(X|~A)</span> - there will always be
some alternative theories that also predict X, and while we go with the
simplest theory that fits the current evidence, you may someday
encounter some evidence that an alternative theory predicts but your
theory does not.&nbsp; That's the hidden gotcha that toppled Newton's
theory of gravity.&nbsp; So there's a limit on how much mileage you can
get from successful predictions; there's a limit on how high the
likelihood ratio goes for <span style="font-style: italic;">confirmatory</span> 
evidence.<br> 
<br> 
On the other hand, if you encounter some piece of evidence Y that is
definitely <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> predicted by
your theory, this is <span style="font-style: italic;">enormously</span> 
strong evidence <span style="font-style: italic;">against</span> your
theory.&nbsp; If <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(Y|A)</span> 
is
infinitesimal, then the likelihood ratio will also be
infinitesimal.&nbsp; For example, if <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(Y|A)</span> is 0.0001%, and <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(Y|~A)</span> is 1%, then the
likelihood ratio <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(Y|A)/p(Y|~A)</span> 
will be 1:10000.&nbsp; -40 decibels of evidence!&nbsp; Or flipping the
likelihood ratio, if <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(Y|A)</span> 
is <span style="font-style: italic;">very small,</span> then <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(Y|~A)/p(Y|A)</span> will be <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">very large,</span> meaning that observing
Y
greatly favors ~A over A.&nbsp; Falsification is much stronger than
confirmation.&nbsp; This is a consequence of the earlier point that <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">very strong</span> evidence is not the
product of a very high probability that A leads to X, but the product
of
a very <span style="font-style: italic;">low</span> probability that <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">not-A</span> could have led to X.&nbsp;
This is the precise Bayesian rule that underlies the heuristic value of
Popper's falsificationism.<br> 
<br> 
Similarly, Popper's dictum that an idea must be falsifiable can be
interpreted as a manifestation of the Bayesian
conservation-of-probability rule; if a result X is positive evidence
for
the theory, then the result ~X would have disconfirmed the theory to
some extent.&nbsp; If you try to interpret both X and ~X as
"confirming"
the theory, the Bayesian rules say this is impossible!&nbsp; To
increase
the probability of a theory you <span style="font-style: italic;">must</span> 
expose it to tests that can potentially decrease its probability; this
is not just a rule for detecting would-be cheaters in the social
process
of science, but a consequence of Bayesian probability theory.&nbsp; On
the other hand, Popper's idea that there is <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">only</span> falsification and <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">no such thing</span> as confirmation turns
out to be incorrect.&nbsp; Bayes' Theorem shows that falsification is <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">very strong</span> evidence compared to
confirmation, but falsification is still probabilistic in nature; it is
not governed by fundamentally different rules from confirmation, as
Popper argued.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br> 
<br> 
So we find that many phenomena in the cognitive sciences, plus the
statistical methods used by<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> 
scientists, plus the scientific method itself, are all turning out to
be
special cases of Bayes' Theorem.&nbsp; Hence the Bayesian revolution.<br>

Why wait so long to introduce Bayes' Theorem, instead of just showing
it at the beginning?&nbsp; Well... because I've tried that before; and
what happens, in my experience, is that people get all tangled up in
trying to apply Bayes' Theorem as a set of <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">poorly grounded mental rules;</span> 
instead of the Theorem helping, it becomes <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">one more thing to juggle mentally,</span> 
so that in addition to trying to remember how many women with breast
cancer have positive mammographies, the reader is also trying to
remember whether it's <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(X|A)</span> 
in the numerator or <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(A|X)</span>,
and whether a positive mammography result corresponds to A or X, and
which side of <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(X|A)</span> is
the
implication, and what the terms are in the denominator, and so
on.&nbsp;
In this excruciatingly gentle introduction, I tried to show all the
workings of Bayesian reasoning <span style="font-style: italic;">without</span> 
ever introducing the explicit Theorem as something extra to memorize,
hopefully reducing the number of factors the reader needed to mentally
juggle.<br> 
<br> 
Even if you happen to be one of the fortunate people who can easily
grasp and apply abstract theorems, the mental-juggling problem is still
something to bear in mind if you ever need to explain Bayesian
reasoning
to someone else.<br> 
<br> 
If you do find yourself losing track, my advice is to forget Bayes'
Theorem as an <span style="font-style: italic;">equation </span>and
think about the <span style="font-style: italic;">graph.</span>&nbsp;
p(A) and p(~A) are at the top.&nbsp; p(X|A) and p(X|~A) are the
projection factors.&nbsp; p(X&amp;A) and p(X&amp;~A) are at the
bottom.&nbsp; And p(A|X) equals the proportion of p(X&amp;A) within
p(X&amp;A)+p(X&amp;~A).&nbsp; The graph isn't shown here - but can you
see it in your mind?<br> 
<br> 
And if thinking about the graph doesn't work, I suggest forgetting
about Bayes' Theorem entirely - just try to work out the specific
problem in gizmos, hoses, and sparks, or whatever it is.<br> 
<br> 
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br> 
Having introduced Bayes' Theorem explicitly, we can explicitly discuss
its components.<br>

<br> 
We'll start with p(A|X).&nbsp; If you ever find yourself getting
confused about what's A and what's X in Bayes' Theorem, start with
p(A|X) on the left side of the equation; that's the simplest part to
interpret.&nbsp; A is the thing we want to know about.&nbsp; X is how
we're observing it; X is the evidence we're using to make inferences
about A.&nbsp; Remember that for every expression p(Q|P), we want to
know about the probability for Q given P, the degree to which P implies
Q - a more sensible notation, which it is now too late to adopt, would
be <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(Q&lt;-P)</span>.<br> 
<br> 
p(Q|P) is closely related to p(Q&amp;P), but they are not
identical.&nbsp; Expressed as a probability or a fraction, p(Q&amp;P)
is
the proportion of things that have property Q and property P within <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">all things;</span> i.e., the proportion of
"women with breast cancer and a positive mammography" within the group
of <span style="font-style: italic;">all women.</span>&nbsp; If the
total number of women is 10,000, and 80 women have breast cancer and a
positive mammography, then p(Q&amp;P) is 80/10,000 = 0.8%.&nbsp; You
might say that the absolute quantity, 80, is being normalized to a
probability relative to the <span style="font-style: italic;">group of
all women.</span>&nbsp; Or to make it clearer, suppose that there's a
group of 641 women with breast cancer and a positive mammography within
a total sample group of 89,031 women.&nbsp; 641 is the absolute
quantity.&nbsp; If you pick out a random woman from the <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">entire sample,</span> then the <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">probability</span> you'll pick a woman
with
breast cancer and a positive mammography is p(Q&amp;P), or 0.72% (in
this example).<br> 
<br> 
On the other hand, p(Q|P) is the proportion of things that have
property Q and property P within <span style="font-style: italic;">all
things that have P;</span> i.e., the proportion of women with breast
cancer and a positive mammography within the group of <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">all women with positive mammographies.</span>&nbsp;
If there are 641 women with breast cancer and positive mammographies,
7915 women with positive mammographies, and 89,031 women, then
p(Q&amp;P) is the probability of getting one of those 641 women if
you're picking at random from the entire group of 89,031, while p(Q|P)
is the probability of getting one of those 641 women if you're picking
at random from the smaller group of 7915.<br> 
<br> 
In a sense, <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(Q|P)</span>really
means <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(Q&amp;P|P)</span>, but
specifying the extra P all the time would be redundant.&nbsp; You
already <span style="font-style: italic;">know</span> it has property
P,
so the property you're <span style="font-style: italic;">investigating</span> 
is Q - even though you're looking at the size of group Q&amp;P within
group P, not the size of group Q within group P (which would be
nonsense).&nbsp; This is what it means to take the property on the
right-hand side as <span style="font-style: italic;">given;</span> it
means you know you're working only within the group of things that have
property P.&nbsp; When you constrict your focus of attention to see
only
this smaller group, many other probabilities change.&nbsp; If you're
taking P as <span style="font-style: italic;">given,</span> then
p(Q&amp;P) equals just p(Q) - at least, <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">relative to the group P.</span>&nbsp; The <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">old</span> p(Q), the frequency of "things
that have property Q within the entire sample", is revised to the new
frequency of "things that have property Q within the subsample of
things
that have property P".&nbsp; If P is <span style="font-style: italic;">given,</span> 
if P is our entire world, then looking for Q&amp;P is the same as
looking for just Q.<br> 
<br> 
If you constrict your focus of attention to only the population of eggs
that are painted blue, then suddenly "the probability that an egg
contains a pearl" becomes a different number; this proportion is
different for the population of blue eggs than the population of all
eggs.&nbsp; The <span style="font-style: italic;">given,</span> the
property that constricts our focus of attention, is always on the <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">right</span> side of p(Q|P); the P becomes
our world, the entire thing we see, and on the other side of the
"given"&nbsp; P always has probability 1 - that is what it means to
take
P as given.&nbsp; So p(Q|P) means "If P has probability 1, what is the
probability of Q?" or "If we constrict our attention to only things or
events where P is true, what is the probability of Q?"&nbsp; Q, on the
other side of the given, is <span style="font-style: italic;">not </span>certain
- its probability may be 10% or 90% or any other number.&nbsp; So when
you use Bayes' Theorem, and you write the part on the left side as
p(A|X) - how to <span style="font-style: italic;">update</span> the
probability of A after seeing X, the new probability of A <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">given</span> that we know X, the degree to
which X <span style="font-style: italic;">implies</span> A - you can
tell that X is always the <span style="font-style: italic;">observation</span> 
or the <span style="font-style: italic;">evidence,</span> and A is the
property being investigated, the thing you want to know about.<br>

<br> 
The first step, <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(A|X)</span> to
<span style="font-family: monospace;">p(X&amp;A)/p(X)</span>, may look
like
a tautology.&nbsp; The actual math performed is different,
though.&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(A|X)</span> is a
single number, the
normalized probability or frequency of A within the subgroup X.&nbsp; <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(X&amp;A)/p(X)</span> are usually the
percentage frequencies of X&amp;A and X within the entire sample, but
the calculation also works if X&amp;A and X are absolute numbers of
people, events, or things.&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(cancer|positive)</span> 
is a single percentage/frequency/probability, always between 0 and
1.&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">(positive&amp;cancer)/(positive)</span> 
can be measured either in probabilities, such as 0.008/0.103, or it
might be expressed in groups of women, for example 194/2494.&nbsp; As
long as both the numerator and denominator are measured in the same
units, it should make no difference.<br> 
<br> 
Going from <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(X)</span> in the
denominator to <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(X&amp;A)+p(X&amp;~A)</span> 
is a very straightforward step whose main purpose is as a stepping
stone
to the last equation.&nbsp; However, one common arithmetical mistake in
Bayesian calculations is to divide <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(X&amp;A)</span> 
by <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(X&amp;~A)</span>, instead
of
dividing <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(X&amp;A)</span> by <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">[p(X&amp;A) + p(X&amp;~A)]</span>.&nbsp;
For example, someone doing the breast cancer calculation tries to get
the posterior probability by performing the math operation 80 / 950,
instead of 80 / (80 + 950).&nbsp; I like to think of this as a
rose-flowers error.&nbsp; Sometimes if you show young children a
picture
with eight roses and two tulips, they'll say that the picture contains
more roses than flowers.&nbsp; (Technically, this would be called a
class inclusion error.)&nbsp; You have to <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">add</span> the roses and the tulips to get
the number of <span style="font-style: italic;">flowers</span>, which
you need to find the proportion of roses <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">within</span> the flowers.&nbsp; You can't
find the proportion of roses in the tulips, or the proportion of tulips
in the roses.&nbsp; When you look at the graph, the bottom bar consists
of <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> the patients with
positive results.&nbsp; That's what the doctor sees - a patient with a
positive result.&nbsp; The question then becomes whether this is a
healthy patient with a positive result, or a cancerous patient with a
positive result.&nbsp; To figure the odds of that, you have to look at
the proportion of cancerous patients with positive results within all
patients who have positive results, because again, "a patient with a
positive result" is what you actually see.&nbsp; You can't divide 80 by
950 because that would mean you were trying to find the proportion of
cancerous patients with positive results within the group of healthy
patients with positive results; it's like asking how many of the tulips
are roses, instead of asking how many of the flowers are roses.&nbsp;
Imagine using the same method to find the proportion of <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">healthy</span> patients.&nbsp; You would
divide 950 by 80 and find that 1,187% of the patients were
healthy.&nbsp; Or to be exact, you would find that 1,187% of cancerous
patients with positive results were healthy patients with positive
results.<br> 
<br> 
The last step in deriving Bayes' Theorem is going from <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(X&amp;A)</span> to <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(X|A)*p(A)</span>, in both the
numerator and the denominator, and from <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(X&amp;~A)</span> to <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(X|~A)*p(~A)</span>, in the
denominator.<br> 
<br> 
Why?&nbsp; Well, one answer is because p(X|A), p(X|~A), and p(A)
correspond to the initial information given in all the story
problems.&nbsp; But why were the story problems written that way?<br> 
<br> 
Because in many cases, p(X|A), p(X|~A), and p(A) are what we actually <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">know;</span> and this in turn happens
because p(X|A) and p(X|~A) are often the quantities that directly
describe <span style="font-style: italic;">causal relations,</span> 
with
the other quantities derived from them and p(A) as <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">statistical relations.</span>&nbsp; For
example, p(X|A), the implication from A to X, where A is what we want
to
know and X is our way of observing it, corresponds to the implication
from a woman having breast cancer to a positive mammography.&nbsp; This
is not just a <span style="font-style: italic;">statistical implication</span> 
but a <span style="font-style: italic;">direct</span> <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">causal relation;</span> a woman gets a
positive mammography <span style="font-style: italic;">because</span> 
she has breast cancer.&nbsp; The mammography is <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">designed </span>to detect breast cancer,
and it is a fact about the physical process of the mammography exam
that
it has an 80% probability of detecting breast cancer.&nbsp; As long as
the design of the mammography machine stays constant, p(X|A) will stay
at 80%, even if p(A) changes - for example, if we screen a group of
woman with other risk factors, so that the prior frequency of women
with
breast cancer is 10% instead of 1%.&nbsp; In this case, p(X&amp;A) will
change along with p(A), and so will p(X), p(A|X), and so on; but p(X|A)
stays at 80%, because that's a fact about the mammography exam
itself.&nbsp; (Though you do need to test this statement before relying
on it; it's possible that the mammography exam might work better on
some
forms of breast cancer than others.)&nbsp; p(X|A) is one of the <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">simple</span> facts from which complex
facts like p(X&amp;A) are constructed; p(X|A) is an <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">elementary </span>causal relation within
a complex system, and it has a direct physical interpretation.&nbsp;
This is why Bayes' Theorem has the form it does; it's not for solving
math brainteasers, but for reasoning about the physical universe.<br> 
<br> 
Once the derivation is finished, all the implications on the right side
of the equation are of the form <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(X|A)</span> 
or <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(X|~A)</span>, while the
implication on the left side is <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(A|X)</span>.&nbsp;
As long as you remember this and you get the rest of the equation
right, it shouldn't matter whether you happened to start out with
p(A|X)
or p(X|A) on the left side of the equation, as long as the rules are
applied <span style="font-style: italic;">consistently</span> - if you
started out with the direction of implication p(X|A) on the left side
of
the equation, you would need to end up with the direction p(A|X) on the
right side of the equation.&nbsp; This, of course, is just changing the
variable labels; the point is to remember the symmetry, in order to
remember the structure of Bayes' Theorem.<br> 
<br> 
The symmetry arises because the elementary <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">causal relations</span> are generally
implications from facts to observations, i.e., from breast cancer to
positive mammography.&nbsp; The elementary <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">steps in reasoning </span>are generally
implications from observations to facts, i.e., from a positive
mammography to breast cancer.&nbsp; The left side of Bayes' Theorem is
an elementary <span style="font-style: italic;">inferential </span>step
from the observation of positive mammography to the conclusion of an
increased probability of breast cancer.&nbsp; Implication is written
right-to-left, so we write <span style="font-family: monospace;">p(cancer|positive)</span> 
on the left side of the equation.&nbsp; The right side of Bayes'
Theorem
describes the elementary <span style="font-style: italic;">causal </span>steps
- for example, from breast cancer to a positive mammography - and so
the implications on the right side of Bayes' Theorem take the form <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive|cancer)</span> or <span 
 style="font-family: monospace;">p(positive|~cancer)</span>.<br> 
<br> 
And that's Bayes' Theorem.&nbsp; Rational inference on the left end,
physical causality on the right end; an equation with mind on one side
and reality on the other.&nbsp; Remember how the scientific method
turned out to be a special case of Bayes' Theorem?&nbsp; If you wanted
to put it poetically, you could say that Bayes' Theorem binds reasoning
into the physical universe.
<p>Okay, we're done. </p>

	<h3>Twelve Virtues of Rationality</h3>


	<p>The first virtue is curiosity. A burning itch to know is higher than a solemn vow to pursue truth. To feel the burning itch of curiosity requires both that you be ignorant, and that you desire to relinquish your ignorance.<br />
