                                <p>Viget has been working on some great .edu projects lately, including sites for <a href="http://duke.edu/">Duke</a>, <a href="http://qatar.sfs.georgetown.edu/">Georgetown</a> and <a href="http://www.lafayette.edu/">Lafayette</a>. Combine that with some exciting new client work and a few recent launches -- including Happy Cog's redesign of <a href="http://georgetown.edu/">Georgetown.edu</a> -- and it's hard for me not to think about this particular design challenge.</p>
<h3>A Little Back Story</h3>
<p>Before I was lucky enough to land a spot at Viget, I spent five years
 working with a small but awesome web team at Syracuse University. Part 
of my job was to act as "webmaster" (ick, I know) for the university 
homepage, making daily updates and answering the often ridiculous 
questions that came through the main contact form. When people wanted a 
link on the homepage, I was the first point of contact. A few years in I
 gave the design (at that point 7+ years young) a temporary 
facelift to patch things up 
until something more comprehensive could be done. Once the redesign ball
 got rolling I sat on a small committee tasked with choosing a CMS for 
university-wide adoption and another small committee that worked closely
 with a large consulting firm to launch a much-needed 
redesign of syr.edu. </p>
<p>When not working on the homepage, my team was tackling sites for 
campus clients from every corner of the university. Our projects 
included large redesigns for schools and colleges, microsites for 
Homecoming and Reunion, holiday e-cards, promotional sites for 
Chancellor initiatives ... Sites at every level and for every type of 
audience. </p>
<p>Over the course of those five years, I came to know and understand 
the struggles of university websites (and homepages in particular) from 
many different angles.</p>
<p>It's no secret that university homepages are, as a whole, pretty lousy. But why? And more importantly, how can we help them improve?</p>                                                                            <p><strong><a href="/inspire/designing-for-edu#continue">Continue reading "Design Challenge: The .edu Homepage"</a></strong></p>

                                <h3>Where I'm Coming From</h3>
<p>Just a few months ago, I was fresh out of school and looking to start a career in web design. A few months later, I was fortunate enough to get an internship, and subsequently, a full-time spot at <a href="http://viget.com/" title="Viget Labs">Viget</a>. Here are a few things I focused on and learned during the process. I hope they can be of some help to you.</p>
<h3>The Necessity of an Online Portfolio</h3>
<p><em>So you want to be a web designer? Show me your website</em>. You'll obviously need one. Use this as an opportunity to display your skills. If you are purely a visual designer with minimal front-end knowledge, it might make more sense to use something like <a href="http://www.behance.net/" title="Behance">Behance</a>&nbsp;(or for other options, <a href="http://www.viget.com/inspire/put-your-portfolio-online" title="Put Your Portfolio Online">check out this post by Tom Osborne</a>). If you love jumping in and putting down some code, go for it and do it all custom. Whatever choice you make, make sure that it highlights your abilities.</p>
<p>A written resume is somewhat a given and is yet another chance to be creative. If you know you want to be a designer, then create a "designer" resume. Flex your typographic muscles and get into some print. I remember seeing the simplicity and clean lines in the resumes of <a class="pdf" href="http://j.mp/dogbnU" title="Brian Hoff">Brian Hoff</a>&nbsp;and <a class="pdf" href="http://onesmallspark.com/resumeMindyWagner_10.pdf" title="Mindy Wagner">Mindy Wagner</a>&nbsp;(pdf files)&nbsp;and being inspired to create my own.</p>
<p>

<em>Quality over quantity</em> is something you hear a lot. Put your best work forward. This seems to be pretty straightforward. That being said, <em>variety ain't a bad thing</em>. Overall creativity is valued; so is general talent and ability. When I put up my portfolio site, I decided to include some acrylic paintings I had done that year. When I got into the initial interview, one of the designers said that it was the first thing that caught his eye. The next question that was asked was: "how can it be applied to the web?" So if you do choose to include some non-web work, be sure to think about ways it may translate to your designs for the web. I'm a firm believer that developing artistic areas outside of your primary focus is always a good idea and will give you new insights and inspiration and will ultimately improve your design skills.</p>                                                                            <p><strong><a href="/inspire/how-to-get-a-job-at-an-awesome-design-company#continue">Continue reading "How to Get a Job at an Awesome Design Company"</a></strong></p>

                                <p>One of jQuery&rsquo;s great strengths is its simple and powerful plugin architecture. The extensible .fn method has been one key to jQuery&rsquo;s success, it lets developers of any experience level quickly produce and distribute their work, and a lot of devs who work with jQuery use plugins and their patterns every day.</p>

<p>Plugins don&rsquo;t have many hard rules, so it shouldn&rsquo;t surprise anyone to find out that there&rsquo;s a huge diversity in implementation styles. Still, if you look at enough plugins, a few patterns useful patterns emerge.</p>

<p>Here are five patterns, each with their own pros and cons, applied to a simple gallery behavior. If you&rsquo;re already using some of these (or prefer even better ones), let me know in the comments. A few points about all five patterns: I&rsquo;m wrapping the plugin code in an immediate (or &lsquo;self-executing&rsquo;) function to create a closure and assign the $ to jQuery. I&rsquo;m also setting options the standard way, combining a passed-in object with a set of defaults. You play around with the gallery I&rsquo;m trying to make <a href="http://www.viget.com/uploads/file/jQueryPatterns/markup/">here.</a></p>

                                <p>We've talked about everyone's favorite thing, HTML emails, before. Jim posted an <a href="http://www.viget.com/inspire/tips-for-coding-html-email/">invaluable list of resources</a>. And Keith posted about <a href="http://www.viget.com/inspire/hotmail-image-problems-in-html-emails/">a buildout trick that will save the day 99% of the time</a>. But I do a lot of HTML emails around here and just read <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/book/">Mathew Patterson's "Create Stunning HTML Email That Just Works!"</a> so I've had them on the brain recently and wanted to share a quick rundown of what Mathew Patterson, and my own fair share of experience, has taught me about the oft maligned HTML email.</p>                                                                            <p><strong><a href="/inspire/and-now-a-brief-message-about-html-emails#continue">Continue reading "&#8230;And Now a Brief Message About HTML Emails"</a></strong></p>

                                <p>Lightboxes have been the <a href="http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/">all</a> the <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jquerylightbox_bal">rage</a> for <a href="http://particletree.com/features/lightbox-gone-wild/">years</a> now; especially since frameworks like <a href="http://www.jquery.com">jQuery</a> make them fairly easy to accomplish.  One little piece that I always find lacking, though, is even the tiniest bit of keyboard support. Want to help your power users out a bit? Bind the escape key to dismissing lightboxes.</p>
<p>The most straightforward way is simply to bind the escape key to trigger a click on the lightbox close button once the lightbox is open.  </p>
<pre>$(document).bind('keyup', function(e) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;if(e.keyCode == 27) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$('.lightbox a.close').click();
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
});
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
</ul>                                                                            <p><strong><a href="/inspire/jquery-niceties-dismissing-lightboxes#continue">Continue reading "jQuery Niceties - Dismissing Lightboxes"</a></strong></p>

                                <p>File inputs are notorious for being a pain to style across all browsers. In the following image, you can see the difference between the default file inputs in the major browsers:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Image showing file inputs in different browsers" height="428" src="http://www.viget.com/uploads/image/file-input-comparison.png" width="435" /></p>
<p>That's pretty gross. I was surprised to see that even Chrome and Safari are different.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Image of a custom file button" class="right" height="48" src="http://www.viget.com/uploads/image/custom-file-input.png" width="156" /></p>
<p>For a recent project, the comp had a form to allow users to upload a photo, but the button was completely custom. So I was challenged to come up with a way to make that button similar across all browsers.</p>
<p>What followed was some CSS trickery and a bit of jQuery to make the input a little more functional.</p>                                                                            <p><strong><a href="/inspire/custom-file-inputs-with-a-bit-of-jquery#continue">Continue reading "Custom File Inputs with a Bit of jQuery"</a></strong></p>

	<p>Great write up Mindy!&nbsp; I noticed some of the same politics when working with high school web sites, though to a much lesser scale thank goodness.

Great work on the Lafeyette site too!
